Abstract
In the View Point article of Reference 1, the editor of CIB was kind enough to let me express my views on the topic of Darwinian evolution. Since then and mainly through contacts generated by that article, I felt that there was more to be said on this topic. The editor was kind enough to allow me to air my views again.
  I have no qualifications in biology or philosophy, so the readers of CIB may find that some of the material on evolution in this article is well-known territory to them, but for me it was a part of the unfolding story that informed my understanding and led me to some conclusions. My thesis is that the explanations based on the present materialist/reductionist views on how experiential qualities developed out of inert matter are unconvincing and that an alternative viewpoint offers a more parsimonious and logically coherent account. The article presents my rearrangement of material contained or taken from references 2, 4, 5, and 6 linked by my own commentary. For a better-argued and ultimately more convincing exposition of the views in this article the interested reader should study the references.

Background
We all have an intimate knowledge of our conscious experience. There is nothing more concrete than the existence of this experience, hence Descartes’s dictum: “I think, therefore I am.” All knowledge, scientific or otherwise, is communicated to us through personal conscious experience, and this is the fundamental core of our being. Matter and experience appear to us as qualitatively different; hence Descartes’s belief that mind (our experiential self) and matter are distinct and of different nature to each other. This is the philosophical tenet of “Dualism,” which asserts that the human mind is essentially immaterial and disembodied. If dualism is taken to be true, it is then not illogical to entertain the possibility of the mind surviving the death of the body, a basic tenet of many religions. The fundamental problem of Dualism is that it has no convincing explanation of how the two realms of mind and matter interact.
Science teaches us that our bodies are made of matter composed by a number of basic chemical elements out of the 90-odd available. It has also been established that the mind is inexorably linked to matter. Brain scans indicate that thoughts are intimately related to brain activity. Brain neurons interact through synaptic connections to generate mental phenomena, and damage to a part of one’s brain affects mental functions.
Physical sciences have been extremely successful in analyzing the material world by reducing complex physical systems into their constituent parts. These parts can be selected to be so small and simple that they become comprehensible. This is the process of “Reductionism.” Reductionist scientists believe that everything, including biology, can be accounted for at the most basic level by the physical sciences. Our experiential life, however, includes complex features such as consciousness, thought, perception, desire, action, perceived freedom of will, intentionality, meaning, purpose, beliefs, and value.
Reductionist science claims that all the above, however sophisticated, can be accommodated in a universe consisting only of physical facts of the kind revealed by the laws of physics. It is confidently proposed that this process will ultimately provide an explanation of the cognitive capacities that enabled us to discover those physical laws.
Contemporary science asserts that reductive materialism is the only serious methodology capable of providing an objective understanding of ourselves. This scientific privileged world view is taken for granted by the large majority of scientists who are not aware of the implications of materialist reductionism, as more than often it has no bearing on the work they do. Among them a small number of prominent and articulate scientists promote this view very vigorously in the media with the explicit aim of liberating the world from alternative explanations such as those provided by religion. This is an understandable agenda if one were to examine history and our present predicaments, many related to conflicts caused by religious superstitions. Such scientists are driven by the laudable but untested belief that if humanity on the whole were to espouse the materialist/reductionist philosophy, the world would be a far better place. Perhaps they are right, but I personally doubt it.
The conundrum, though, persists. How can experiential phenomena be physical phenomena? Some philosophers and scientists take the materialist/reductionist agenda to be profoundly problematic. This is the mind-body problem.
Materialist/reductionist explanation of how biological complexity and mentality developed
The explanation given of our appearance on Earth assumes an undirected and accidental combination of the basic chemicals of life that resulted in a primitive organized physical system that was capable of reproducing itself. The reproduction was performed by means of a chemical code embedded in this primitive organized system or early life form. In the process of reproduction, occasionally errors were made in the code. The progeny that inherited errors that adapted it to cope better in the battle for existence survived; others perished. The slight reproductive advantages some organisms inherit over others is the core tenet of the Darwinian evolution by natural selection. This evolution process over millions of years has developed organisms vastly more complex than single cells.
The appearance of basic experiential functions and learning behavior in primitive organisms, i.e., the collection and processing of data from the environment and the response of the organism to absorb nutrition, excrete waste, avoid danger, and attack predators were all developed through the accumulation of these small, accidental, but advantageous changes. This primitive cell intelligence or mentality gradually developed into the more complex range of responses by higher animals (e.g., ant experience or pigeon experience) and the limited consciousness of primates such as chimpanzees. In humans, consciousness has developed into self-awareness that resulted in higher experiential functions, such as language, perceived freedom of will, intentionality, meaning, purpose, and value. This physico-chemical reductionism in biology is now confidently accepted by most scientists as a scientifically rigorous world view. The impression is given that the fundamental mechanism is settled and that only details need working out. Karl Popper referred to this situation as “promissory materialism.”
The rest of us who are not biologists have been schooled through popular science literature, radio, and television to regard this reductive program as the undisputed and legitimate scientific explanation. Is, though, this “scientific” explanation that has now reached a hegemonic status credible? Can mental or experiential functions be the outcome of the laws of physics? Can the laws of physics capture the nature or essence of experience?
How do materialists explain the appearance of mind
There are a number of schools of thought that endeavor to explain how mind is derived from matter on the assumption that the latter is the only reality.
An early approach was to consider mentality as an “epiphenomenon,” i.e., a by-product of brain activity. T.H. Huxley compared consciousness to “...the steam whistle that accompanies the work of a locomotive engine … without influence upon its machinery.” In this approach, human beings are “conscious automata.”
A more radical approach is to deny the existence of experience completely, thus avoiding the task of explaining it. D Dennett claims that subjective experience is illusory. This denial of the phenomenon whose existence is self evidently more certain than the existence of anything else is considered by a number of philosophers, to say the least, as bizarre. However, this view has considerable support as it bypasses the hard problem.
In “eliminative materialism,” mental phenomena are considered to be an “aspect” of brain activity, i.e., they are basically physical phenomena talked about in a different way.
In “cognitive psychology,” the brain is viewed as a computer and mental activity as information processing with experiential activity reduced to a computational processes.
Perhaps the most prevalent view among scientists is to consider experiential phenomena as “emergent.” According to this concept, physical staff in its basic nature is wholly non-conscious and non-experiential. Nevertheless, when parts of it combine in certain ways so that some critical magnitude of complexity is reached, experiential phenomena “emerge.” The most quoted example of emergence is the liquidity property of water. Liquidity is not a characteristic of individual water molecules, and yet when many of those are put together they exhibit liquidity, an “emergent” property. But is this analogy helpful in illuminating the mind/body problem? This “emergent” quality of water can be derived from the properties possessed by certain molecules that are so constituted that they do not bind together in a tight formation but slide past each other. So the phenomenon of liquidity is wholly dependent on phenomena that do not in themselves involve liquidity. In spite of its implausibility, this “emergence” idea is held by most scientific materialists as being at the bottom of the mind/body problem, ignoring the fact that for mentality to truly emerge from matter, matter must have something—indeed everything—to do with it.
Is there an alternative explanation?
The profusion of rival theories gives a flavor of the confusion underlying the attempts to derive mentality from passive matter. It seems logical that for experience to emerge from something such as matter, then matter must be experiential in some sense or other. It must be experiential in its essential and fundamental nature no matter what conventional materialism believes. This though, is not to ascribe to atoms consciousness in the way humans experience it. It is important to stress that this view in no way contradicts the fact that experience is associated with neurons firing. However, in contrast to the prevailing materialist view, the proposal is that there is a lot more to neurons than physics and neurophysiology.
Has quantum physics got anything to do with this?
At the very basic level, elementary particles are in continuous interaction with their neighbors. They are attracted or repelled by the surrounding charges and have many alternative futures. Physicists have developed mathematical theories to account for these behaviors.
Many phenomena in quantum physics are paradoxical. In the two slit experiment, elementary particles appear to communicate. The “entanglement” concept requires that quantum particles share information with their neighbors, and Bell’s theorem postulates that this sharing is instantaneous and involves “spooky action at a distance,” a property that was confirmed in laboratory experiments.
Freeman Dyson, the eminent particle physicist, wrote: “I think that consciousness is not just a passive epiphenomenon carried along by the chemical events on our brains, but is an active agent forcing the molecular complexes to make choices between one quantum state and another. In other words, mind is already inherent in every electron, and the process of human consciousness differ only in degree but not in kind from the process of choice between quantum states which we call ‘chance’ when they are made by an electron.”
David Bohm developed a quantum theory3 in which mind and matter are brought together. He writes: “A similar mind-like quality of matter reveals itself strongly at the quantum level, in the sense that the form of the wave function manifests itself in the movements of the particles.”
Bertrand Russell said pithily: “We know nothing about the intrinsic quality of physical events except when these are mental events that we directly experience.” And: “Physics is mathematical not because we know so much about the physical world but because we know so little: it is only its mathematical properties we can discover.”
Finally, the following quote from A Eddington, the eminent British astrophysicist, carries considerable logical force: “Our knowledge of the nature of the objects treated in physics consists solely on readings of pointers (on instrument dials) and other indicators. This being so, what knowledge have we of the nature of atoms that renders it at all incongruous that they should constitute a thinking object? Absolutely none. Science has nothing to say about the intrinsic nature of the atom. The schedule of pointer readings is attached to some unknown background. Why not attach it to something of spiritual (mental) nature in which a prominent characteristic is thought (i.e., experience, consciousness). It seems rather silly to prefer to attach it to something of a so called ‘concrete’ nature inconsistent with thought, and then to wonder where the thought comes from.”
Panpsychism
Panpsychism is the philosophical position that confers a mental quality to all the elements of the physical world. This has been a time-honored scientific and philosophical tradition espoused in some way or another by Heraclitus, Empedocles, Bruno, Cardano, Leibniz, Spinoza, Schopenhauer, Priestly, William James, Mach, Bergson, Whitehead, Eddington, Broad, Bohm, Waddington, Dyson, and recently, Strawson, Nagel, Skrbina, Hameroff, Chalmers, Seager, Rosenberg, Schooler, and others.
On the plausible basis that elementary particles enjoy a rudimentary experiential quality, physical aggregations of them as in rocks and non-biological systems have no discernible increased coherent unified mentality. It is with biological self-organizing systems that complex forms of experience develop out of the aggregated “micro-mentality” of the atoms. One of the organizing processes is evolution through natural selection.
Like all viewpoints, panpsychism is not problem-free. The question is how in biological systems the micro-mentality of elementary particles combines in a coherent way to generate higher levels of experiential properties as we move up the evolutionary tree from prions to cells to plants to animals to human beings. We can only authoritatively make statements about our own human experiential quality, which we perceive as unified and not fragmentary. An analogy from physics may shed some light. The core of an unmagnetized piece of iron consists of a great number of microscopic magnetic domains with their axes distributed in a haphazard way that renders this piece externally non-magnetic. If, however, an appropriate external magnetic field is applied, the domains align themselves along its direction. The combined effect of the micro-magnets caused the iron piece to become a permanent magnet. The two states of the magnet may be loosely thought to represent haphazard non-organic and coherent organic matter respectively. The panpsychist process of enhanced levels of experiential quality in organic systems through the combination of lower levels is, though, still a mystery but not one that offends logic.
To conclude
Science is driven by the assumption that the world is intelligible, but likely to be wrong in its certainty that we know enough about the physical to claim that the experiential cannot be physical. The intelligibility of the world is no accident. Nature is such as to give rise to conscious beings with minds, and it is such as to be comprehensible to such beings. Mind is not just an afterthought or an accident or an add-on, but a basic aspect of matter. The possibilities were inherent in the Universe long before there was life. If evolution is to produce sentient beings, the roots of consciousness in some shape must have been present at the very origin of things.
A speculative teleological hypothesis is that evolution may be determined not merely by value-free chemistry and physics but also by a cosmic predisposition toward complexity, connectivity, the formation of life, consciousness, increased awareness, and the value that is inseparable from such qualities. Our dominant scientific culture of materialist reductionism is heavily dependent on traditional Darwinian explanations and resistant to alternative views. This has discouraged from the scientific and philosophical mainstream any alternative view such as panpsychism, even if this view is the most parsimonious account available to resolve the mind/matter conundrum. Panpsychism does not require an explanation of how so ontologically different a quality as consciousness emerged from matter where none existed before. It also obliquely recognizes that purpose is inherent in all nature.
Finally, it is important to assess the psychological impact on humanity of the present predominant reductionist worldview. It is not illogical to blame this materialist mindset as one of the primary causes of our present social, consumerist, and environmental problems. Mechanistic materialism can be viewed as having been originally of benefit, one that liberated at least part of humanity from stifling theology and religious superstition, and yet now seems to have reached the end of its useful life. The raping of the planet’s fauna, flora, and earth resources appears to be permissible in a world dominated either by a utilitarian/materialist or a human-centered religious world view. This would be corrected if matter were to be accepted as having an experiential quality. Panpsychism may be able to provide the foundation for a new paradigm that addresses the root issues of our dislocation from nature.
Postscript by Erwin Schrodinger7
“But now let us assume that in a particular case you eventually observe several efferent bundles of pulsating currents, which issue from the brain and through long cellular protrusions (motor nerve fibres), are conducted to certain muscles of the arm, which, as a consequence, tends a hesitating, trembling hand to you to bid you farewell—for a long heart rendering separation; at the same time you may find that some other pulsating bundles produce a certain glandular secretion so as to veil the poor sad eye with a crape of tears. But nowhere along this way from the eye through the central organ to the arm muscles and the tear glands—nowhere, you may find, however far physiology advances, will you ever meet the personality, will you ever meet the dire pain, the bewildered worry within this soul, though their reality is to you so certain as though you suffered them yourself – as in actual fact you do!”

Panpsychism
Panpsychism is the philosophical position that confers a mental quality to all the elements of the physical world. This has been a time-honored scientific and philosophical tradition espoused in some way or another by Heraclitus, Empedocles, Bruno, Cardano, Leibniz, Spinoza, Schopenhauer, Priestly, William James, Mach, Bergson, Whitehead, Eddington, Broad, Bohm, Waddington, Dyson, and recently, Strawson, Nagel, Skrbina, Hameroff, Chalmers, Seager, Rosenberg, Schooler, and others.

The intelligibility of the world is no accident. Nature is such as to give rise to conscious beings with minds, and it is such as to be comprehensible to such beings. Mind is not just an afterthought or an accident or an add-on, but a basic aspect of matter. The possibilities were inherent in the Universe long before there was life. If evolution is to produce sentient beings, the roots of consciousness in some shape must have been present at the very origin of things.
A speculative teleological hypothesis is that evolution may be determined not merely by value-free chemistry and physics but also by a cosmic predisposition toward complexity, connectivity, the formation of life, consciousness, increased awareness, and the value that is inseparable from such qualities. Our dominant scientific culture of materialist reductionism is heavily dependent on traditional Darwinian explanations and resistant to alternative views. This has discouraged from the scientific and philosophical mainstream any alternative view such as panpsychism, even if this view is the most parsimonious account available to resolve the mind/matter conundrum. Panpsychism does not require an explanation of how so ontologically different a quality as consciousness emerged from matter where none existed before. It also obliquely recognizes that purpose is inherent in all nature.
Finally, it is important to assess the psychological impact on humanity of the present predominant reductionist worldview. It is not illogical to blame this materialist mindset as one of the primary causes of our present social, consumerist, and environmental problems. Mechanistic materialism can be viewed as having been originally of benefit, one that liberated at least part of humanity from stifling theology and religious superstition, and yet now seems to have reached the end of its useful life. The raping of the planet’s fauna, flora, and earth resources appears to be permissible in a world dominated either by a utilitarian/materialist or a human-centered religious world view. This would be corrected if matter were to be accepted as having an experiential quality. Panpsychism may be able to provide the foundation for a new paradigm that addresses the root issues of our dislocation from nature.
Postscript by Erwin Schrodinger7
“But now let us assume that in a particular case you eventually observe several efferent bundles of pulsating currents, which issue from the brain and through long cellular protrusions (motor nerve fibres), are conducted to certain muscles of the arm, which, as a consequence, tends a hesitating, trembling hand to you to bid you farewell—for a long heart rendering separation; at the same time you may find that some other pulsating bundles produce a certain glandular secretion so as to veil the poor sad eye with a crape of tears. But nowhere along this way from the eye through the central organ to the arm muscles and the tear glands—nowhere, you may find, however far physiology advances, will you ever meet the personality, will you ever meet the dire pain, the bewildered worry within this soul, though their reality is to you so certain as though you suffered them yourself – as in actual fact you do!”

To mind something means it bothers you. If something matters, it is important.

It depends on the wider context.  The phrase 'to mind' applies to a person's feelings or attitude.  The phrase 'to matter' can apply to a person but also as a fact.  For example, 'it doesn't matter to me' (I don't mind), but 'it doesn't matter if the wall falls down' (fact).

I can definitely see the confusion, since these would both translate to "(no) me importa" in Spanish. There is no difference in meaning between these two expressions, but there is a difference in structure. While you would say "I (don't) mind X", you must say that "X does(n't) matter to me". I hope that makes sense.

Chris is very correct,

Adding to that some examples:

I don't mind that at all.
It doesn't matter.  
What matter is that to me (a noun in this case).  

Mind is when it's important to you, matter is when it's not important more in general.

Dualism and Mind
Dualists in the philosophy of mind emphasize the radical difference between mind and matter. They all deny that the mind is the same as the brain, and some deny that the mind is wholly a product of the brain. This article explores the various ways that dualists attempt to explain this radical difference between the mental and the physical world. A wide range of arguments for and against the various dualistic options are discussed.
Substance dualists typically argue that the mind and the body are composed of different substances and that the mind is a thinking thing that lacks the usual attributes of physical objects: size, shape, location, solidity, motion, adherence to the laws of physics, and so on. Substance dualists fall into several camps depending upon how they think mind and body are related. Interactionists believe that minds and bodies causally affect one another. Occasionalists and parallelists, generally motivated by a concern to preserve the integrity of physical science, deny this, ultimately attributing all apparent interaction to God. Epiphenomenalists offer a compromise theory, asserting that bodily events can have mental events as effects while denying that the reverse is true, avoiding any threat to the scientific law of conservation of energy at the expense of the common sense notion that we act for reasons.
Property dualists argue that mental states are irreducible attributes of brain states. For the property dualist, mental phenomena are non-physical properties of physical substances. Consciousness is perhaps the most widely recognized example of a non-physical property of physical substances. Still other dualists argue that mental states, dispositions and episodes are brain states, although the states cannot be conceptualized in exactly the same way without loss of meaning.
Dualists commonly argue for the distinction of mind and matter by employing Leibniz’s Law of Identity, according to which two things are identical if, and only if, they simultaneously share exactly the same qualities. The dualist then attempts to identify attributes of mind that are lacked by matter (such as privacy or intentionality) or vice versa (such as having a certain temperature or electrical charge). Opponents typically argue that dualism is (a) inconsistent with known laws or truths of science (such as the aforementioned law of thermodynamics), (b) conceptually incoherent (because immaterial minds could not be individuated or because mind-body interaction is not humanly conceivable), or (c) reducible to absurdity (because it leads to solipsism, the epistemological belief that one’s self is the only existence that can be verified and known).

1. Dualism
The most basic form of dualism is substance dualism, which requires that mind and body be composed of two ontologically distinct substances. The term “substance” may be variously understood, but for our initial purposes we may subscribe to the account of a substance, associated with D. M. Armstrong, as what is logically capable of independent existence. (Armstrong, 1968, p. 7). According to the dualist, the mind (or the soul) is comprised of a non-physical substance, while the body is constituted of the physical substance known as matter. According to most substance dualists, mind and body are capable of causally affecting each other. This form of substance dualism is known as interactionism.
Two other forms of substance dualism are occasionalism and parallelism. These theories are largely relics of history. The occasionalist holds that mind and body do not interact. They may seem to when, for example, we hit our thumb with a hammer and a painful and distressing sensation occurs. Occassionalists, like Malebranche, assert that the sensation is not caused by the hammer and nerves, but instead by God. God uses the occasion of environmental happenings to create appropriate experiences.
According to the parallelist, our mental and physical histories are coordinated so that mental events appear to cause physical events (and vice versa) by virtue of their temporal conjunction, but mind and body no more interact than two clocks that are synchronized so that the one chimes when hands of the other point out the new hour. Since this fantastic series of harmonies could not possibly be due to mere coincidence, a religious explanation is advanced. God does not intervene continuously in creation, as the occasionalist holds, but builds into creation a pre-established harmony that largely eliminates the need for future interference.
Another form of dualism is property dualism. Property dualists claim that mental phenomena are non-physical properties of physical phenomena, but not properties of non-physical substances. Some forms of epiphenomenalism fall into this category. According to epiphenomenalism, bodily events or processes can generate mental events or processes, but mental phenomena do not cause bodily events or processes (or, on some accounts, anything at all, including other mental states). (McLaughlin, p. 277) Whether an epiphenomenalist thinks these mental epiphenomena are properties of the body or properties of a non-physical mental medium determines whether the epiphenomenalist is a property or substance dualist.
Still other dualists hold not that mind and body are distinct ontologically, but our mentalistic vocabulary cannot be reduced to a physicalistic vocabulary. In this sort of dualism, mind and body are conceptually distinct, though the phenomena referred to by mentalistic and physicalistic terminology are coextensive.
The following sections first discuss dualism as expounded by two of its primary defenders, Plato and Descartes. This is followed by additional arguments for and against dualism, with special emphasis on substance dualism, the historically most important and influential version of dualism.
2. Platonic Dualism in the Phaedo
The primary source for Plato‘s views on the metaphysical status of the soul is the Phaedo, set on the final day of Socrates’ life before his self-administered execution. Plato (through the mouth of Socrates, his dramatic persona) likens the body to a prison in which the soul is confined. While imprisoned, the mind is compelled to investigate the truth by means of the body and is incapable (or severely hindered) of acquiring knowledge of the highest, eternal, unchanging, and non-perceptible objects of knowledge, the Forms. Forms are universals and represent the essences of sensible particulars. While encumbered by the body, the soul is forced to seek truth via the organs of perception, but this results in an inability to comprehend that which is most real. We perceive equal things, but not Equality itself. We perceive beautiful things but not Beauty itself. To achieve knowledge or insight into the pure essences of things, the soul must itself become pure through the practice of philosophy or, as Plato has Socrates provocatively put it in the dialogue, through practicing dying while still alive. The soul must struggle to disassociate itself from the body as far as possible and turn its attention toward the contemplation of intelligible but invisible things. Though perfect understanding of the Forms is likely to elude us in this life (if only because the needs of the body and its infirmities are a constant distraction), knowledge is available to pure souls before and after death, which is defined as the separation of the soul from the body.
a. The Argument From Opposites
Plato’s Phaedo contains several arguments in support of his contention that the soul can exist without the body. According to the first of the Phaedo‘s arguments, the Argument from Opposites, things that have an opposite come to be from their opposite. For example, if something comes to be taller, it must come to be taller from having been shorter; if something comes to be heavier, it must come to be so by first having been lighter. These processes can go in either direction. That is, things can become taller, but they also can become shorter; things can become sweeter, but also more bitter. In the Phaedo, Socrates notes that we awaken from having been asleep and go to sleep from having been awake. Similarly, since dying comes from living, living must come from dying. Thus, we must come to life again after we die. During the interim between death and rebirth the soul exists apart from the body and has the opportunity to glimpse the Forms unmingled with matter in their pure and undiluted fullness. Death liberates the soul, greatly increasing its apprehension of truth. As such, the philosophical soul is unafraid to die and indeed looks forward to death as to liberation.
b. The Argument From Recollection
A second argument from the Phaedo is the Argument from Recollection. Socrates argues that the soul must exist prior to birth because we can recollect things that could not have been learned in this life. For example, according to Socrates we realize that equal things can appear to be unequal or can be equal in some respects but not others. People can disagree about whether two sticks are equal. They may disagree about if they are equal in length, weight, color, or even whether they are equally “sticks.” The Form of Equality—Equality Itself—can never be or appear unequal. According to Socrates, we recognize that the sticks are unequal and that they are striving to be equal but are nevertheless deficient in terms of their equality. Now, if we can notice that the sticks are unequal, we must comprehend what Equality is. Just as I could not recognize that a portrait was a poor likeness of your grandfather unless I already knew what your grandfather looked like, I cannot reccognize that the sticks are unequal by means of the senses, without an understanding of the Form of Equality. We begin to perceive at birth or shortly thereafter. Hence, the soul must have existed prior to birth. It existed before it acquires a body. (A similar argument is developed in Plato’s Meno (81a-86b).
c. The Argument From Affinity
A third argument from the Phaedo is the Argument from Affinity. Socrates claims that things that are composite are more liable to be destroyed than things that are simple. The Forms are true unities and therefore least likely ever to be annihilated. Socrates then posits that invisible things such as Forms are not apt to be disintegrated, whereas visible things, which all consist of parts, are susceptible to decay and corruption. Since the body is visible and composite, it is subject to decomposition. The soul, on the other hand, is invisible. The soul also becomes like the Forms if it is steadfastly devoted to their consideration and purifies itself by having no more association with the body than necessary. Since the invisible things are the durable things, the soul, being invisible, must outlast the body. Further, the philosophical soul, that becomes Form-like, is immortal and survives the death of the body.
d. Criticisms of the Platonic Arguments
Some of these arguments are challenged even in the Phaedo itself by Socrates’ friends Simmias and Cebes and the general consensus among modern philosophers is that the arguments fail to establish the immortality of the soul and its independence and separability from the body. (Traces of the Affinity argument in a more refined form will be observed in Descartes below). The Argument from Opposites applies only to things that have an opposite and, as Aristotle notes, substances have no contraries. Further, even if life comes from what is itself not alive, it does not follow that the living human comes from the union of a dead (i.e. separated) soul and a body. The principle that everything comes to be from its opposite via a two-directional process cannot hold up to critical scrutiny. Although one becomes older from having been younger, there is no corresponding reverse process leading the older to become younger. If aging is a uni-directional process, perhaps dying is as well. Cats and dogs come to be from cats and dogs, not from the opposites of these (if they have opposites). The Arguments from Recollection and Affinity, on the other hand, presuppose the existence of Forms and are therefore no more secure than the Forms themselves (as Socrates notes in the Phaedo at 76d-e).
We turn now to Descartes’ highly influential defense of dualism in the early modern period.
3. Descartes’ Dualism
The most famous philosophical work of René Descartes is the Meditations on First Philosophy (1641). In the Sixth Meditation, Descartes calls the mind a thing that thinks and not an extended thing. He defines the body as an extended thing and not a thing that thinks (1980, p. 93). “But what then am I? A thing that thinks. What is that? A thing that doubts, understands, affirms, denies, wills, refuses, and which also imagines and senses.” (1980, p. 63). He expands on the notion of extension in the Fifth Meditation saying, “I enumerate the [extended] thing’s various parts. I ascribe to these parts certain sizes, shapes, positions, and movements from place to place; to these movements I ascribe various durations” (1980, p. 85). Bodies, but not minds, are describable by predicates denoting entirely quantifiable qualities and hence bodies are fit objects for scientific study.
Having thus supplied us with the meanings of “mind” and “body,” Descartes proceeds to state his doctrine: “I am present to my body not merely in the way a seaman is present to his ship, but . . . I am tightly joined and, so to speak, mingled together with it, so much so that I make up one single thing with it” (1980, p. 94). The place where this “joining” was believed by Descartes to be especially true was the pineal gland—the seat of the soul. “Although the soul is joined to the whole body, there is yet in the body a certain part in which it seems to exercise its functions more specifically than in all the others. . . I seem to find evidence that the part of the body in which the soul exercises its functions immediately is. . . solely the innermost part of the brain, namely, a certain very small gland.” (1952, p. 294). When we wish to “move the body in any manner, this volition causes the gland to impel the spirits towards the muscles which bring about this effect” (1952, p. 299). Conversely, the body is also able to influence the soul. Light reflected from the body of an animal and entering through our two eyes “form but one image on the gland, which, acting immediately on the soul, causes it to see the shape of the animal.” (1952, p. 295-96).
It is clear, then, that Descartes held to a form of interactionism, believing that mental events can sometimes cause bodily events and that bodily events can sometimes cause mental events. (This reading of Descartes-as-interactionist has recently been challenged. See Baker and Morris (1996). Also, Daniel Garber suggests that Descartes is a quasi-occasionalist, permitting minds to act on bodies, but invoking God to explain the actions of inanimate bodies on each other and phenomena where bodies act on minds, such as sensation. See Garber, 2001, ch. 10).
a. The Argument From Indivisibility
Descartes’ primary metaphysical justification of the distinction of mind and body is the Argument from Indivisibility. He writes, “there is a great difference between a mind and a body, because the body, by its very nature, is something divisible, whereas the mind is plainly indivisible. . . insofar as I am only a thing that thinks, I cannot distinguish any parts in me. . . . Although the whole mind seems to be united to the whole body, nevertheless, were a foot or an arm or any other bodily part amputated, I know that nothing would be taken away from the mind. . .” (1980, p. 97). Decartes argues that the mind is indivisible because it lacks extension. The body, as an object that takes up space, can always be divided (at least conceptually), whereas the mind is simple and non-spatial. Since the mind and body have different attributes, they must not be the same thing, their “unity” notwithstanding.
This Indivisibility Argument makes use of Leibniz’s Law of Identity: two things are the same if, and only if, they have all of the same properties at the same time. More formally, x is identical to y if, and only if, for any property p had by x at time t, y also has p at t, and vice versa. Descartes uses Leibniz’s Law to show that the mind and body are not identical because they do not have all of the same properties. An illustration (for present purposes a property can be considered anything that may be predicated of a subject): If the man with the martini is the mayor, it must be possible to predicate all and only the same properties of both “the man” and “the mayor,” including occupying (or having bodies that occupy) the same exact spatial location at the same time.
Since divisibility may be predicated of bodies (and all of their parts, such as brains) and may not be predicated of minds, Leibniz’s Law suggests that minds cannot be identical to bodies or any of their parts or systems. Although it makes sense to speak of the left or right half of the brain, it makes no sense to speak of half of a desire, several pieces of a headache, part of joy, or two-thirds of a belief. What is true of mental states is held to be true of the mind that has the states as well. In the synopsis of the Meditations, Descartes writes, “we cannot conceive of half a soul, as we can in the case of any body, however small.” (1980, p. 52). The mind has many ideas, but they are all ideas of one indivisible mind.
b. Issues Raised by the Indivisibility Argument
John Locke argued that awareness is rendered discontinuous by intervals of sleep, anesthesia, or unconsciousness. (Bk.II, ch.I, sect.10). Is awareness then divisible? Locke suggests that the mind cannot exhibit temporal discontinuity and also have thought as its essence. But even if Descartes was wrong to consider the mind an essentially thinking thing, the concept of mind is not reduced to vacuity if some other, positive characteristic can be found by which to define it. But what might that be? (Without some such means of characterizing the mind it would be defined entirely negatively and we would have no idea what it is).
Against Locke, Dualists can argue in several ways. (1) That the mind has both conscious and unconscious thoughts and that Locke’s argument shows only that the mind is not always engaged in conscious reflection, though it may be perpetually busy at the unconscious level. Locke argues that such a maneuver creates grave difficulties for personal identity (Bk.II, Ch.I, sect.11), however, and denies that thoughts can exist unperceived. (2) Dualists can argue that the soul always thinks, but that the memory fails to preserve those thoughts when asleep or under anesthesia. (3) Dualists can argue that the Lockean observation is not relevant to the Argument from Indivisibility because the discontinuity Locke identifies in consciousness is not a spatial discontinuity but a temporal one. The Argument from Indivisibility seeks to show that bodies but not minds are spatially divisible and that argument is not rebutted by pointing out that consciousness is temporally divisible. (Indeed, if minds are temporally divisible and bodies are not, we have an argument for dualism of a different sort).
David Hume, on the other hand, questioned of what the unity of consciousness might consist. The Indivisibility Argument suggests that the mind is a simple unity. Hume finds no reason to grant or assume that the diversity of our experiences (whether visual perception, pain or active thinking and mathematical apprehension) constitute a unity rather than a diversity. For Hume, all introspection reveals is the presence of various impressions and ideas, but does not reveal a subject in which those ideas inhere. Accordingly, if observation is to yield knowledge of the self, the self can consist in nothing but a bundle of perceptions. Even talk of a “bundle” is misleading if that suggests an empirically discoverable internal unity. Thus, Descartes’ commitment to a res cogitans or thing which thinks is unfounded and substance dualism is undermined. (For a contrary view on what constitutes the unity of the self, see Madell’s view that, “What unites all of my experiences…is simply that they all have the irreducible and unanalyzable property of ‘mineness,'” in Nagel, 1986, p. 34, n. 5).
Immanuel Kant replied to Hume that we must suppose or posit the unity of the ego (which he called the “transcendental unity of apperception”) as a preliminary to all experience since without such a unity the manifold of sense-data (or “sensibility”) could not constitute, for example, the experience of seeing a clock. However, Kant agreed that we must not mistake the unity of apperception for the perception of unity—that is, the perception of a unitary thing or substance. Kant also argued that there is little reason to suppose that the mind or ego cannot be destroyed despite its unity since its powers may gradually attenuate to the point where they simply fade away. The mind need not be separated into non-physical granules to be destroyed since it can suffer a kind of death through loss of its powers. Awareness, perception, memory and the like admit of degrees. If the degree of consciousness decreases to zero, then the mind is effectively annihilated. Even if, as Plato and Descartes agree, the mind is not divisible, it does not follow that it survives (or could survive) separation from the body. Additionally, if the mind is neither physical nor identical to its inessential characteristics (1980, p. 53), it is impossible to distinguish one mind from another. Kant argues that two substances that are otherwise identical can be differentiated only by their spatial locations. If minds are not differentiated by their contents and have no spatial positions to distinguish them, there remains no basis for individuating their identities. (On numerically individuating non-physical substances, see Armstrong, 1968, pp. 27-29. For a general discussion of whether the self is a substance, see Shoemaker, 1963, ch. 2).
c. The Argument From Indubitability
Descartes’ other major argument for dualism in the Meditations derives from epistemological considerations. After taking up his celebrated method of doubt, which commits him to reject as false anything that is in the slightest degree uncertain, Descartes finds that the entirety of the physical world is uncertain. Perhaps, after all, it is nothing but an elaborate phantasm wrought by an all-powerful and infinitely clever, but deceitful, demon. Still, he cannot doubt his own existence, since he must exist to doubt. Because he thinks, he is. But he cannot be his body, since that identity is doubtful and possibly altogether false. Therefore, he is a non-bodily “thinking thing,” or mind. As Richard Rorty puts it: “If we look in Descartes for a common factor which pains, dreams, memory-images, and veridical and hallucinatory perceptions share with concepts of (and judgments about) God, number, and the ultimate constituents of matter, we find no explicit doctrine. . . . The answer I would give to the question ‘What did Descartes find?’ is ‘Indubitability'” (1979 p. 54). In sum, I cannot doubt the existence of my mind, but I can doubt the existence of my body. Since what I cannot doubt cannot be identical to what I can doubt (by Leibniz’s Law), mind and body are not identical and dualism is established.
This argument is also featured in Descartes’ Discourse on Method part four: “[S]eeing that I could pretend that I had no body and that there was no world nor any place where I was, but that I could not pretend, on that account, that I did not exist; and that, on the contrary, from the very fact that I thought about doubting the truth of other things, it followed very evidently and very certainly that I existed. . . . From this I knew that I was a substance the whole essence or nature of which was merely to think, and which, in order to exist, needed no place and depended on no material things. Thus this ‘I,’ that is, the soul through which I am what I am, is entirely distinct from the body. . .” (1980, p. 18).
The Argument from Indubitability has been maligned in the philosophical literature from the very beginning. Most famously, Arnauld comments in the objections originally published with the Meditations that, “Just as a man errs in not believing that the equality of the square on its base to the squares on its sides belongs to the nature of that triangle, which he clearly and distinctly knows to be right angled, so why am I perhaps not in the wrong in thinking that nothing else belongs to my nature which I clearly and distinctly know to be something that thinks, except that fact that I am this thinking being? Perhaps it also belongs to my essence to be something extended.” (1912, p. 84). Suppose that I cannot doubt whether a given figure is a triangle, but can doubt whether its interior angles add up to two right angles. It does not follow from this that the number of degrees in triangles may be more or less than 180. This is because the doubt concerning the number of degrees in a triangle is a property of me, not of triangles. Similarly, I may doubt that my body is not a property of my body, believing it to be a property of whatever part of me it is that doubts, and that “whatever” may be something extended.
The dualist can reply in two ways. First, he or she may argue that, while doubting the body is not a property of bodies, being doubtable is a property of bodies. Since bodies have the property of being doubtable, and minds do not, by Leibniz’s Law the diversity of the two is established. Second, the dualist may reply that it is always possible to doubt whether the figure before me is a triangle. As such, Arnauld’s supposedly parallel argument is not parallel at all. Similar objections are open against other, more recent rebuttals to Descartes’ argument. Consider, for example, the following parallel argument from Paul Churchland (1988, p. 32): I cannot doubt that Mohammed Ali was a famous heavyweight boxer but can doubt that Cassius Clay was a famous heavyweight boxer. Following Descartes, it ought to be that Ali is not Clay (though in fact Clay was a famous heavyweight and identical to Ali). By way of reply, surely it is possible for an evil demon to deceive me about whether Mohammed Ali was a famous heavyweight boxer. So, the dualist might insist, the case of mind is unique in its immunity from doubt. It is only with reference to our own mental states that we can be said to know incorrigibly.
d. The Real Distinction Argument
A third argument in the Meditations maintains that the mind and body must really be separate because Descartes can conceive of the one without the other. Since he can clearly and distinctly understand the body without the mind and vice versa, God could really have created them separately. But if the mind and body can exist independently, they must really be independent, for nothing can constitute a part of the essence of a thing that can be absent without the thing itself ceasing to be. If the essence of the mind is incorporeal, so must be the mind itself.
4. Other Leibniz’s Law Arguments for Dualism
a. Privacy and First Person Authority
As noted earlier, dualists have argued for their position by employing Leibniz’s Law in many ingenious ways. The general strategy is to identify some property or feature indisputably had by mental phenomena but not attributable in any meaningful way to bodily or nervous phenomena, or vice versa. For example, some have suggested that mental states are private in the sense that only those who possess them can know them directly. If I desire an apple, I know that I have this desire “introspectively.” Others can know of my desire only by means of my verbal or non-verbal behavior or, conceivably, by inspection of my brain. (The latter assumes a correlation, if not an identity, between nervous and mental states or events). My linguistic, bodily and neural activities are public in the sense that anyone suitably placed can observe them. Since mental states are private to their possessors, but brain states are not, mental states cannot be identical to brain states. (Rey pp. 55-56).
A closely related argument emphasizes that my own mental states are knowable without inference; I know them “immediately.” (Harman, 1973, pp. 35-37). Others can know my mental states only by making inferences based on my verbal, non-verbal or neurophysiological activity. You may infer that I believe it will rain from the fact that I am carrying an umbrella, but I do not infer that I believe it will rain from noticing that I am carrying an umbrella. I do not need to infer my mental states because I know them immediately. Since mental states are knowable without inference in the first person case, but are knowable (or at least plausibly assigned) only by inference in the third person case, we have an authority or incorrigibility with reference to our own mental states that no one else could have. Since beliefs about the physical world are always subject to revision (our inferences or theories could be mistaken), mental states are not physical states.
b. Intentionality
Some mental states exhibit intentionality. Intentional mental states include, but are not limited to, intendings, such as plans to buy milk at the store. They are states that are about, of, for, or towards things other than themselves. Desires, beliefs, loves, hates, perceptions and memories are common intentional states. For example, I may have a desire for an apple; I may have love for or towards my neighbor; I may have a belief about republicans or academics; or I may have memories of my grandfather.
The dualist claims that brain states, however, cannot plausibly be ascribed intentionality. How can a pattern of neural firings be of or about or towards anything other than itself? As a purely physical event, an influx of sodium ions through the membrane of a neural cell creating a polarity differential between the inside and outside of the cell wall, and hence an electrical discharge, cannot be of Paris, about my grandfather, or for an apple. [Although Brentano goes further than most contemporary philosophers in regarding all mental phenomena as intentional, he argues that “the reference to something as an object is a distinguishing characteristic of all mental phenomena. No physical phenomena exhibits anything similar.” (Brentano, 1874/1973, p. 97, quoted in Rey, 1997, p. 23).] Thus, by Leibniz’s Law, if minds are capable of intentional states and bodies are not, minds and bodies must be distinct. (Taylor, pp. 11-12; Rey pp. 57-59).
c. Truth and Meaning
Another attempt to derive dualism by means of Leibniz’s Law observes that some mental states, especially beliefs, have truth-values. My belief that it will rain can be either true or false. But, the dualist may urge, as a purely physical event, an electrical or chemical discharge in the brain cannot be true or false. Indeed, it lacks not only truth, but also linguistic meaning. Since mental states such as beliefs possess truth-value and semantics, it seems incoherent to attribute these properties to bodily states. Thus, mental states are not bodily states. Presumably, then, the minds that have these states are also non-physical. (Churchland, 1988, p. 30; Taylor, 1983, p. 12).
d. Problems with Leibniz’s Law Arguments for Dualism
Although each of these arguments for dualism may be criticized individually, they are typically thought to share a common flaw: they assume that because some aspect of mental states, such as privacy, intentionality, truth, or meaning cannot be attributed to physical substances, they must be attributable to non-physical substances. But if we do not understand how such states and their properties can be generated by the central nervous system, we are no closer to understanding how they might be produced by minds. (Nagel, 1986, p. 29). The question is not, “How do brains generate mental states that can only be known directly by their possessors?” Rather, the relavent question is “How can any such thing as a substance, of whatever sort, do these things?” The mystery is as great when we posit a mind as the basis of these operations or capacities as when we attribute them to bodies. Dualists cannot explain the mechanisms by which souls generate meaning, truth, intentionality or self-awareness.Thus, dualism creates no explanatory advantage. As such, we should use Ockham’s razor to shave off the spiritual substance, because we ought not to multiply entities beyond what is necessary to explain the phenomena. Descartes’ prodigious doubt notwithstanding, we have excellent reasons for thinking that bodies exist. If the only reasons for supposing that non-physical minds exist are the phenomena of intentionality, privacy and the like, then dualism unnecessarily complicates the metaphysics of personhood.
On the other hand, dualists commonly argue that it makes no sense to attribute some characteristics of body to mind; that to do so is to commit what Gilbert Ryle called a “category mistake.” For example, it makes perfect sense to ask where the hypothalamus is, but not, in ordinary contexts, to ask where my beliefs are. We can ask how much the brain weighs, but not how much the mind weighs. We can ask how many miles per hour my body is moving, but not how many miles per hour my mind is moving. Minds are just not the sorts of things that can have size, shape, weight, location, motion, and the other attributes that Descartes ascribes to extended reality. We literally could not understand someone who informed us that the memories of his last holiday are two inches behind the bridge of his nose or that his perception of the color red is straight back from his left eye. If these claims are correct, then some Leibniz’s Law arguments for dualism are not obviously vulnerable to the critique above.
5. The Free Will and Moral Arguments
Another argument for dualism claims that dualism is required for free will. If dualism is false, then presumably materialism, the thesis that humans are entirely physical beings, is true. (We set aside consideration of idealism—the thesis that only minds and ideas exist). If materialism were true, then every motion of bodies should be determined by the laws of physics, which govern the actions and reactions of everything in the universe. But a robust sense of freedom presupposes that we are free, not merely to do as we please, but that we are free to do otherwise than as we do. This, in turn, requires that the cause of our actions not be fixed by natural laws. Since, according to the dualist, the mind is non-physical, there is no need to suppose it bound by the physical laws that govern the body. So, a strong sense of free will is compatible with dualism but incompatible with materialism. Since freedom in just this sense is required for moral appraisal, the dualist can also argue that materialism, but not dualism, is incompatible with ethics. (Taylor, 1983, p. 11; cf. Rey, 1997, pp. 52-53). This, the dualist may claim, creates a strong presumption in favor of their metaphysics.
This argument is sometimes countered by arguing that free will is actually compatible with materialism or that even if the dualistic account of the will is correct, it is irrelevant because no volition on the part of a non-physical substance could alter the course of nature anyway. As Bernard Williams puts it, “Descartes’ distinction between two realms, designed to insulate responsible human action from mechanical causation, insulated the world of mechanical causation, that is to say, the whole of the external world, from responsible human action. Man would be free only if there was nothing he could do.” (1966, p. 7). Moreover, behaviorist opponents argue that if dualism is true, moral appraisal is meaningless since it is impossible to determine another person’s volitions if they are intrinsically private and otherworldly.
6. Property Dualism
Property dualists claim that mental phenomena are non-physical properties of physical phenomena, but not properties of non-physical substances. Property dualists are not committed to the existence of non-physical substances, but are committed to the irreducibility of mental phenomena to physical phenomena.
An argument for property dualism, derived from Thomas Nagel and Saul Kripke, is as follows: We can assert that warmth is identical to mean kinetic molecular energy, despite appearances, by claiming that warmth is how molecular energy is perceived or manifested in consciousness. Minds detect molecular energy by experiencing warmth; warmth “fixes the reference” of heat. (“Heat” is a rigid designator of molecular motion; “the sensation of heat” is a non-rigid designator.) Similarly, color is identical to electromagnetic reflectance efficiencies, inasmuch as color is how electromagnetic wavelengths are processed by human consciousness. In these cases, the appearance can be distinguished from the reality. Heat is molecular motion, though it appears to us as warmth. Other beings, for example, Martians, might well apprehend molecular motion in another fashion. They would grasp the same objective reality, but by correlating it with different experiences. We move toward a more objective understanding of heat when we understand it as molecular energy rather than as warmth. in our case, or as whatever it appears to them to be in theirs. Consciousness itself, however, cannot be reduced to brain activity along analogous lines because we should then need to say that consciousness is how brain activity is perceived in consciousness, leaving consciousness unreduced. Put differently, when it comes to consciousness, the appearance is the reality. Therefore, no reduction is possible. Nagel writes:
Experience . . . does not seem to fit the pattern. The idea of moving from appearance to reality seems to make no sense here. What is the analogue in this case to pursuing a more objective understanding of the same phenomena by abandoning the initial subjective viewpoint toward them in favor of another that is more objective but concerns the same thing? Certainly it appears unlikely that we will get closer to the real nature of human experience by leaving behind the particularity of our human point of view and striving for a description in terms accessible to beings that could not imagine what it was like to be us. (Nagel 1974; reprinted in Block et. al. p. 523).
Consciousness is thus sui generis (of its own kind), and successful reductions elsewhere should give us little confidence when it comes to experience.
Some property dualists, such as Jaegwon Kim, liken “having a mind” to “a property, capacity, or characteristic that humans and some higher animals possess in contrast with things like pencils and rocks. . . . Mentality is a broad and complex property.” (Kim, 1996, p. 5). Kim continues: “[Some properties] are physical, like having a certain mass or temperature, being 1 meter long, and being heavier than. Some things—in particular, persons and certain biological organisms—can also instantiate mental properties, like being in pain and liking the taste of avocado.” (p. 6). Once we admit the existence of mental properties, we can inquire into the nature of the relationship between mental and physical properties. According to the supervenience thesis, there can be no mental differences without corresponding physical differences. If, for example, I feel a headache, there must be some change not only in my mental state, but also in my body (presumably, in my brain). If Mary is in pain, but Erin is not, then, according to the supervenience thesis, there must be a physical difference between Mary and Erin. For example, Mary’s c-fibers are firing and Erin’s are not. If this is true, it is possible to argue for a type of property dualism by arguing that some mental states or properties, especially the phenomenal aspects of consciousness, do not “supervene on” physical states or properties in regular, lawlike ways. (Kim, p. 169).
Why deny supervenience? Because it seems entirely conceivable that there could exist a twin Earth where all of the physical properties that characterize the actual world are instantiated and are interrelated as they are here, but where the inhabitants are “zombies” without experience, or where the inhabitants have inverted qualia relative to their true-Earth counterparts. If it is possible to have mental differences without physical differences, then mental properties cannot be identical to or reducible to physical properties. They would exist as facts about the world over and above the purely physical facts. Put differently, it always makes sense to wonder “why we exist and not zombies.” (Chalmers, 1996, p. 110). (Kim, 169 and following.; Kripke, 1980, throughout; Chalmers, 1996, throughout, but esp. chs. 3 & 4).
Some have attempted to rebut this “conceivability argument” by noting that the fact that we can ostensibly imagine such a zombie world does not mean that it is possible. Without the actual existence of such a world, the argument that mental properties do not supervene on physical properties fails.
A second rebuttal avers that absent qualia thought experiments (and inverted spectra though experiments) only support property dualism if we can imagine these possibilities obtaining. Perhaps we think we can conceive a zombie world, when we really can’t. We may think we can conceive of such a world but attempts to do so do not actually achieve such a conception.
To illustrate, suppose that Goldbach’s Conjecture is true. If it is, its truth is necessary. If, then, someone thought that they imagined a proof that the thesis is false, they would be conceiving the falsity of what is in reality a necessary truth. This is implausible. What we should rather say in such a case is that the person was mistaken, and that what they imagined false was not Goldbach’s Conjecture after all, or that the “proof” that was imagined was in fact no proof, or that what they were really imagining was something like an excited mathematician shouting, “Eureka! So it’s false then!” Perhaps it is likewise when we “conceive” a zombie universe. We may be mistaken about what it is that we are actually “picturing” to ourselves. Against this objection, however, one could argue that there are independent grounds for thinking that the truth-value of Goldbach’s theorem is necessary and no independent reasons for thinking that Zombie worlds are impossible; therefore, the dualist deserves the benefit of the doubt.
But perhaps the physicalist can come up with independent reasons for supposing that the dualist has failed to imagine what she claims. The physicalist can point, for example, to successful reductions in other areas of science. On the basis of these cases she can argue the implausibility of supposing that, uniquely, mental phenomena resist reduction to the causal properties of matter. That is, an inductive argument for reduction outweighs a conceivability argument against reduction. And in that case, the dualist must do more than merely insist that she has correctly imagined inverted spectra in isomorphic individuals. (For useful discussions of some of these issues, see Tye 1986 and Horgan 1987.)
7. Objections to Dualism Motivated by Scientific Considerations
The Ockham’s Razor argument creates a strong methodological presumption against dualism, suggesting that the mind-body split multiplies entities unnecessarily in much the way that a demon theory of disease complicates the metaphysics of medicine compared to a germ theory. It is often alleged, more broadly, that dualism is unscientific and renders impossible any genuine science of mind or truly empirical psychology.
a. Arguments from Human Development
Those eager to defend the relevance of science to the study of mind, such as Paul Churchland, have argued that dualism is inconsistent with the facts of human evolution and fetal development. (1988, pp. 27-28; see also Lycan, 1996, p. 168). According to this view, we began as wholly physical beings. This is true of the species and the individual human. No one seriously supposes that newly fertilized ova are imbued with minds or that the original cell in the primordial sea was conscious. But from those entirely physical origins, nothing non-physical was later added. We can explain the evolution from the unicellular stage to present complexities by means of random mutations and natural selection in the species case and through the accretion of matter through nutritional intake in the individual case. But if we, as species or individuals, began as wholly physical beings and nothing nonphysical was later added, then we are still wholly physical creatures. Thus, dualism is false. The above arguments are only as strong as our reasons for thinking that we began as wholly material beings and that nothing non-physical was later added. Some people, particularly the religious, will object that macro-evolution of a species is problematic or that God might well have infused the developing fetus with a soul at some point in the developmental process (traditionally at quickening). Most contemporary philosophers of mind put little value in these rejoinders.
b. The Conservation of Energy Argument
Others argue that dualism is scientifically unacceptable because it violates the well-established principle of the conservation of energy. Interactionists argue that mind and matter causally interact. But if the spiritual realm is continually impinging on the universe and effecting changes, the total level of energy in the cosmos must be increasing or at least fluctuating. This is because it takes physical energy to do physical work. If the will alters states of affairs in the world (such as the state of my brain), then mental energy is somehow converted into physical energy. At the point of conversion, one would anticipate a physically inexplicable increase in the energy present within the system. If it also takes material energy to activate the mind, then “physical energy would have to vanish and reappear inside human brains.” (Lycan, 1996, 168).
The dualists’ basically have three ways of replying. First, they could deny the sacredness of the principle of the conservation of energy. This would be a desperate measure. The principle is too well established and its denial too ad hoc. Second, the dualist might offer that mind does contribute energy to our world, but that this addition is so slight, in relation to our means of detection, as to be negligible. This is really a re-statement of the first reply above, except that here the principle is valid in so far as it is capable of verification. Science can continue as usual, but it would be unreasonable to extend the law beyond our ability to confirm it experimentally. That would be to step from the empirical to the speculative—the very thing that the materialist objects to in dualism. The third option sidesteps the issue by appealing to another, perhaps equally valid, principle of physics. Keith Campbell (1970) writes:
The indeterminacy of quantum laws means that any one of a range of outcomes of atomic events in the brain is equally compatible with known physical laws. And differences on the quantum scale can accumulate into very great differences in overall brain condition. So there is some room for spiritual activity even within the limits set by physical law. There could be, without violation of physical law, a general spiritual constraint upon what occurs inside the head. (p. 54)
Mind could act upon physical processes by “affecting their course but not breaking in upon them” (1970, p. 54). If this is true, the dualist could maintain the conservation principle but deny a fluctuation in energy because the mind serves to “guide” or control neural events by choosing one set of quantum outcomes rather than another. Further, it should be remembered that the conservation of energy is designed around material interaction; it is mute on how mind might interact with matter. After all, a Cartesian rationalist might insist, if God exists we surely wouldn’t say that He couldn’t do miracles just because that would violate the first law of thermodynamics, would we?
c. Problems of Interaction
The conservation of energy argument points to a more general complaint often made against dualism: that interaction between mental and physical substances would involve a causal impossibility. Since the mind is, on the Cartesian model, immaterial and unextended, it can have no size, shape, location, mass, motion or solidity. How then can minds act on bodies? What sort of mechanism could convey information of the sort bodily movement requires, between ontologically autonomous realms? To suppose that non-physical minds can move bodies is like supposing that imaginary locomotives can pull real boxcars. Put differently, if mind-body interaction is possible, every voluntary action is akin to the paranormal power of telekinesis, or “mind over matter.” If minds can, without spatial location, move bodies, why can my mind move immediately only one particular body and no others? Confronting the conundrum of interaction implicit in his theory, Descartes posited the existence of “animal spirits” somewhat subtler than bodies but thicker than minds. Unfortunately, this expedient proved a dead-end, since it is as incomprehensible how the mind could initiate motion in the animal spirits as in matter itself.
These problems involved in mind-body causality are commonly considered decisive refutations of interactionism. However, many interesting questions arise in this area. We want to ask: “How is mind-body interaction possible? Where does the interaction occur? What is the nature of the interface between mind and matter? How are volitions translated into states of affairs? Aren’t minds and bodies insufficiently alike for the one to effect changes in the other?”
It is useful to be reminded, however, that to be bewildered by something is not in itself to present an argument against, or even evidence against, the possibility of that thing being a matter of fact. To ask “How is it possible that . . . ?” is merely to raise a topic for discussion. And if the dualist doesn’t know or cannot say how minds and bodies interact, what follows about dualism? Nothing much. It only follows that dualists do not know everything about metaphysics. But so what? Psychologists, physicists, sociologists, and economists don’t know everything about their respective disciplines. Why should the dualist be any different? In short, dualists can argue that they should not be put on the defensive by the request for clarification about the nature and possibility of interaction or by the criticism that they have no research strategy for producing this clarification.
The objection that minds and bodies cannot interact can be the expression of two different sorts of view. On the one hand, the detractor may insist that it is physically impossible that minds act on bodies. If this means that minds, being non-physical, cannot physically act on bodies, the claim is true but trivial. If it means that mind-body interaction violates the laws of physics (such as the first law of thermodynamics, discussed above), the dualist can reply that minds clearly do act on bodies and so the violation is only apparent and not real. (After all, if we do things for reasons, our beliefs and desires cause some of our actions). If the materialist insists that we are able to act on our beliefs, desires and perceptions only because they are material and not spiritual, the dualist can turn the tables on his naturalistic opponents and ask how matter, regardless of its organization, can produce conscious thoughts, feelings and perceptions. How, the dualist might ask, by adding complexity to the structure of the brain, do we manage to leap beyond the quantitative into the realm of experience? The relationship between consciousness and brain processes leaves the materialist with a causal mystery perhaps as puzzling as that confronting the dualist.
On the other hand, the materialist may argue that it is a conceptual truth that mind and matter cannot interact. This, however, requires that we embrace the rationalist thesis that causes can be known a priori. Many prefer to assert that causation is a matter for empirical investigation. We cannot, however, rule out mental causes based solely on the logic or grammar of the locutions “mind” and “matter.” Furthermore, in order to defeat interactionism by an appeal to causal impossibility, one must first refute the Humean equation of causal connection with regularity of sequence and constant conjunction. Otherwise, anything can be the cause of anything else. If volitions are constantly conjoined with bodily movements and regularly precede them, they are Humean causes. In short, if Hume is correct, we cannot refute dualism a priori by asserting that transactions between minds and bodies involve links where, by definition, none can occur.
Some, such as Ducasse (1961, 88; cf. Dicker pp. 217-224), argue that the interaction problem rests on a failure to distinguish between remote and proximate causes. While it makes sense to ask how depressing the accelerator causes the automobile to speed up, it makes no sense to ask how pressing the accelerator pedal causes the pedal to move. We can sensibly ask how to spell a word in sign language, but not how to move a finger. Proximate causes are “basic” and analysis of them is impossible. There is no “how” to basic actions, which are brute facts. Perhaps the mind’s influence on the pineal gland is basic and brute.
One final note: epiphenomenalism, like occasionalism and parallelism, is a dualistic theory of mind designed, in part, to avoid the difficulties involved in mental-physical causation (although occasionalism was also offered by Malebranche as an account of seemingly purely physical causation). According to epiphenomenalism, bodies are able to act on minds, but not the reverse. The causes of behavior are wholly physical. As such, we need not worry about how objects without mass or physical force can alter behavior. Nor need we be concerned with violations of the conservation of energy principle since there is little reason to suppose that physical energy is required to do non-physical work. If bodies affect modifications in the mental medium, that need not be thought to involve a siphoning of energy from the world to the psychic realm. On this view, the mind may be likened to the steam from a train engine; the steam does not affect the workings of the engine but is caused by it. Unfortunately, epiphenomenalism avoids the problem of interaction only at the expense of denying the common-sense view that our states of mind have some bearing on our conduct. For many, epiphenomenalism is therefore not a viable theory of mind. (For a defense of the common-sense claim that beliefs and attitudes and reasons cause behavior, see Donald Davidson.)
d. The Correlation and Dependence Arguments
The correlation and dependence argument against dualism begins by noting that there are clear correlations between certain mental events and neural events (say, between pain and a-fiber or c-fiber stimulation). Moreover, as demonstrated in such phenomena as memory loss due to head trauma or wasting disease, the mind and its capacities seem dependent upon neural function. The simplest and best explanation of this dependence and correlation is that mental states and events are neural states and events and that pain just is c-fiber stimulation. (This would be the argument employed by an identity theorist. A functionalist would argue that the best explanation for the dependence and correlation of mental and physical states is that, in humans, mental states are brain states functionally defined).
Descartes himself anticipated an objection like this and argued that dependence does not strongly support identity. He illustrates by means of the following example: a virtuoso violinist cannot manifest his or her ability if given an instrument in deplorable or broken condition. The manifestation of the musician’s ability is thus dependent upon being able to use a well-tuned instrument in proper working order. But from the fact that the exhibition of the maestro’s skill is impossible without a functioning instrument, it hardly follows that being skilled at playing the violin amounts to no more than possessing such an instrument. Similarly, the interactionist can claim that the mind uses the brain to manifest it’s abilities in the public realm. If, like the violin, the brain is in a severely diseased or injurious state, the mind cannot demonstrate its abilities; they of necessity remain private and unrevealed. However, for all we know, the mind still has its full range of abilities, but is hindered in its capacity to express them. As for correlation, interactionism actually predicts that mental events are caused by brain events and vice versa, so the fact that perceptions are correlated with activity in the visual cortex does not support materialism over this form of dualism. Property dualists agree with the materialists that mental phenomena are dependent upon physical phenomena, since the fomer are (non-physical) attributes of the latter. Materialists are aware of these dualist replies and sometimes invoke Ockham’s razor and the importance of metaphysical simplicity in arguments to the best explanation. (See Churchland, 1988, p. 28). Other materialist responses will not be considered here.
8. The Problem of Other Minds
The problem of how we can know other minds has been used as follows to refute dualism. If the mind is not publicly observable, the existence of minds other than our own must be inferred from the behavior of the other person or organism. The reliability of this inference is deeply suspect, however, since we only know that certain mental states cause characteristic behavior from our own case. To extrapolate to the population as a whole from the direct inspection of a single example, our own case, is to make the weakest possible inductive generalization. Hence, if dualism is true, we cannot know that other people have minds at all. But common sense tell us that others do have minds. Since common sense can be trust, dualism is false.
This problem of other minds, to which dualism leads so naturally, is often used to support rival theories such as behaviorism, the mind-brain identity theory, or functionalism (though functionalists sometimes claim that their theory is consistent with dualism). Since the mind, construed along Cartesian lines, leads to solipsism (that is, to the epistemological belief that one’s self is the only existence that can be verified and known), it is better to operationalize the mind and define mental states behaviorally, functionally, or physiologically. If mental states are just behavioral states, brain states, or functional states, then we can verify that others have mental states on the basis of publicly observable phenomena, thereby avoiding skepticism about other selves.
Materialist theories are far less vulnerable to the problem of other minds than dualist theories, though even here other versions of the problem stubbornly reappear. Deciding to define mental states behaviorally does not mean that mental states are behavioral, and it is controversial whether attempts to reduce mentality to behavioral, brain, or functional states have been successful. Moreover, the “Absent Qualia” argument claims that it is perfectly imaginable and consistent with everything that we know about physiology that, of two functionally or physiologically isomorphic beings, one might be conscious and the other not. Of two outwardly indistinguishable dopplegangers, one might have experience and the other none. Both would exhibit identical neural activity; both would insist that they can see the flowers in the meadow and deny that they are “blind”; both would be able to obey the request to go fetch a red flower; and yet only one would have experience. The other would be like an automaton. Consequently, it is sometimes argued, even a materialist cannot be wholly sure that other existing minds have experience of a qualitative (whence, “qualia”) sort. The problem for the materialist then becomes not the problem of other minds, but the problem of other qualia. The latter seems almost as severe an affront to common sense as the former. (For an interesting related discussion, see Churchland on eliminative materialism, 1988, pp. 43-49.)
9. Criticisms of the Mind as a Thinking Thing
We earlier observed that some philosophers, such as Hume, have objected that supposing that the mind is a thinking thing is not warranted since all we apprehend of the self by introspection is a collection of ideas but never the mind that purportedly has these ideas. All we are therefore left with is a stream of impressions and ideas but no persisting, substantial self to constitute personal identity. If there is no substratum of thought, then substance dualism is false. Kant, too, denied that the mind is a substance. Mind is simply the unifying factor that is the logical preliminary to experience.
The idea that the mind is not a thinking thing was revived in the twentieth century by philosophical behaviorists. According to Gilbert Ryle in his seminal 1949 work The Concept of Mind, “when we describe people as exercising qualities of mind, we are not referring to occult episodes of which their overt acts and utterances are effects; we are referring to those overt acts and utterances themselves.” (p. 25). Thus, “When a person is described by one or other of the intelligence epithets such as ‘shrewd’ or ‘silly’, ‘prudent’ or ‘imprudent’, the description imputes to him not the knowledge, or ignorance, of this or that truth, but the ability, or inability, to do certain sorts of things.” (p. 27). For the behaviorist, we say that the clown is clever because he can fall down deliberately yet make it look like an accident We say the student is bright because she can tell us the correct answer to complex, involved equations. Mental events reduce to bodily events or statements about the body. As Ludwig Wittgenstein notes in his Blue Book:
It is misleading then to talk of thinking as of a “mental activity.” We may say that thinking is essentially the activity of operating with signs. This activity is performed by the hand, when we think by writing; by the mouth and larynx, when we think by speaking; and if we think by imagining signs or pictures, I can give you no agent that thinks. If then you say that in such cases the mind thinks, I would only draw your attention to the fact that you are using a metaphor. (1958, p. 6)
John Wisdom (1934) explains: “‘I believe monkeys detest jaguars’ means ‘This body is in a state which is liable to result in the group of reactions which is associated with confident utterance of ‘Monkeys detest jaguars,’ namely keeping ‘favorite’ monkeys from jaguars and in general acting as if monkeys detested jaguars.'” (p. 56-7).
Philosophical behaviorism as developed by followers of Wittgenstein was supported in part by the Private Language Argument. Anthony Kenny (1963) explains:
Any word purporting to be the name of something observable only by introspection (i.e. a mental event)… would have to acquire its meaning by a purely private and uncheckable performance . . . If the names of the emotions acquire their meaning for each of us by a ceremony from which everyone else is excluded, then none of us can have any idea what anyone else means by the word. Nor can anyone know what he means by the word himself; for to know the meaning of a word is to know how to use it rightly; and where there can be no check on how a man uses a word there is no room to talk of “right” and “wrong” use (p. 13).
Mentalistic terms do not have meaning by virtue of referring to occult phenomena, but by virtue of referring to something public in a certain way. To understand the meaning of words like “mind,” “idea,” “thought,” “love,” “fear,” “belief,” “dream,” and so forth, we must attend to how these words are actually learned in the first place. When we do this, the behaviorist is confident that the mind will be demystified.
Although philosophical behaviorism has fallen out of fashion, its recommendations to attend to the importance of the body and language in attempting to understand the mind have remained enduring contributions. Although dualism faces serious challenges, we have seen that many of these difficulties can be identified in its philosophical rivals in slightly different forms.

Every creation begins as a thought, from a symphony to a marriage to an ice cream cone to a rocket launch. When we have an intention, a complex chain of events begins in our brains. Thoughts travel as electrical impulses along neural pathways. When neurons fire together they wire together, creating electromagnetic fields. These fields are invisible energy, yet they influence the molecules of matter around us the way a magnet organizes iron filings.
In Mind to Matter, award-winning researcher Dawson Church explains the science showing how our minds create matter. Different intentions produce different fields and different material creations. The thoughts and energy fields we cultivate in our minds condition the atoms and molecules around us. We can now trace the science behind each link in chain from thought to thing, showing the surprising ways in which our intentions create the material world.
The science in the book is illustrated by many authentic case histories of people who harnessed the extraordinary power of the mind to create. They include: •Adeline, whose Stage 4 cancer disappeared after she imagined "healing stars" •Raymond Aaron and two of his clients, each of whom manifested $1 million in the same week •Elon Musk, who bounced back from devastating tragedy to found Tesla and SpaceX •Graham Phillips, who grew the emotional regulation part of his brain by 22.8% in two months •Jennifer Graf, whose grandfather’s long-dead radio came to life to play love songs the day of her wedding •Harold, whose 80% hearing loss reversed in an hour •Joe Marana, whose deceased sister comforted him from beyond the grave •Rick Geggie, whose clogged arteries cleared up the night before cardiac surgery •Matthias Rust, a teen whose "airplane flight for peace" changed the fate of superpowers •Wanda Burch, whose dream about cancer told the surgeon exactly where to look for it •An MIT freshman student who can precipitate sodium crystals with his mind •John, who found himself floating out of his body and returned to find his AIDS healed •Dean, whose cortisol levels dropped by 48% in a single hour
In Mind to Matter, Dawson Church shows that these outcomes aren’t a lucky accident only a few people experience. Neuroscientists have measured a specific brain wave formula that is linked to manifestation. This "flow state" can be learned and applied by anyone. New discoveries in epigenetics, neuroscience, electromagnetism, psychology, vibration, and quantum physics connect each step in the process by which mind creates matter. They show that the whole universe is self-organizing, and when our minds are in a state of flow, they coordinate with nature's emergent intelligence to produce synchronous outcomes. The book contained over 150 photos and illustrations that explain the process, while an "Extended Play" section at the end of each chapter provides additional resources. As Mind to Matter drops each piece of the scientific puzzle into place, it leaves us with a profound understanding of the enormous creative potential of our minds. It also gives us a road map to cultivating these remarkable brain states in our daily lives.

Review
"If you’ve been wondering whether your thoughts really do affect your life, this marvelous book will make you a believer. From the level of the atom to the level of our bodies to the level of the galaxies, Dawson Church’s painstaking research shows that mind is profoundly creative. Synthesizing hundreds of studies in the fields of biology, physics, and psychology, he shows that moment by moment, the energy fields of our brains are literally creating reality. These insights can have a radical effect on your health and prosperity, and I highly recommend you apply them in your life."
— John Gray, #1 New York Times best-selling author of Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus

"We have entered an era of healing in which the influence of consciousness in health and illness is being validated as never before. For a view of these crucial insights, researcher Dawson Church’s Mind to Matter is invaluable."
— Larry Dossey, M.D., author of One Mind: How Our Individual Mind Is Part of a Greater Consciousness and Why It Matters

"Dawson Church’s careful scientific work shows that the Law of Attraction isn’t just a metaphysical proposition—it’s a scientific reality. Drawing from hundreds of studies, and illustrated with inspiring real-life stories, it demystifies the intricate mechanisms by which thoughts become things. As the boundaries of what you believe is possible for your life are stretched by Dawson’s work, they may never snap back to their old shape."
— Marci Shimoff, #1 New York Times best-selling author of Happy for No Reason

"I love this book. It constantly fascinated me with delicious facts and so many captivating stories. And it is wonderful to see science catching up with what the shamans and sages have always known!"
— Donna Eden, author of Energy Medicine

"Once in a long while, a profoundly disruptive vision shatters the scientific paradigm, refocuses the entire way we see the world, and opens up vast new horizons of human potential. For our generation, this book is that vision."
— Raymond Aaron, New York Times best-selling author of Chicken Soup for the Parent’s Soul

"Dawson Church has again proven himself to be one of the great thinkers of our time, demystifying the most complex principles in the universe that influence our lives, with a story-telling ability that makes it all fun and easy to understand. By weaving eye-opening research into engaging, heart-warming stories, an awareness emerges of the power your own mind has to not only direct your life but influence the collective consciousness of the universe itself which binds us together as one."
— Robert Hoss, co-author of Dreams That Change Our Lives; Director, DreamScience Foundation

"This groundbreaking book presents the exciting new scientific evidence demonstrating that our thoughts have a direct impact on the world around us, and it shows us how to harness this knowledge for joyful and effective lives."
— David Feinstein, Ph.D., co-author of Personal Mythology

"I believe that Mind to Matter is one of the most important books ever written. Chapter after chapter it shows us how we are masters of our bodies and the world around us. It’s filled with mind-blowing research that has completely changed the way I approach my life. The results I’m getting by applying the techniques are astonishing. They can transform your mind and the world of matter around you. I can’t recommend this book highly enough."
— Matt Gallant, author of Triple Your Productivity

"Mind to Matter challenges the core principles of modern medicine and conventional science. Dawson Church makes a compelling case that the mind/body link is more profound than we ever suspected, and that science must expand its paradigm to include forces like consciousness, resonance, and energy. Profusely illustrated, the book includes an impressive compendium of research citations, from classic papers to recent breakthroughs. Many practical examples and exercises provide tools to work on our own personal transformation and, if the book’s thesis of interconnection is correct, our social transformation as well. I highly recommend this book."
— Eric Leskowitz, M.D., Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School

"Dawson Church has been a pioneer in the field of healing for decades, his research far ahead of its time. His book Mind to Matter is perfectly timed for an era in which people are opening up to the science and research behind energy techniques. Dawson offers a brilliant and insightful guide to how our thoughts create our reality. Packed with fascinating history from the dawn of evolution to the latest brain research, his work is a blueprint for both experts and non-professionals looking for effective healing strategies. Dawson succinctly shows us not just that these methods work, but the empirical basis for how they work. If you have ever wanted to learn the science of manifestation and how your thoughts affect your material world, this book is a must-read. It will change your thoughts, and applying these principles every day will in turn change your reality. The question is—what will you create after you read it?"
— Peta Stapleton, Ph.D., School of Psychology, Bond University, Australia

"Many in our culture are shifting from powerless victims to powerful co-creators. Yet as this evolutionary impulse toward greater power emerges, we are coming face to face with what happens when power is abused. As we face global crises of unpredictable proportions, we need heart-based creators of deep integrity in touch with their power now more than ever. What would be possible in our lives and on our planet if we connected our power with our hearts? What does science have to say about such manifesting power? Mind to Matter explores this edge of how our power to participate in the co-creation of reality functions from the scientific perspective. It also calls us out on how to avoid overstating our human power, as so many ‘law of attraction’ books mistakenly promise. As our power grows, we are called to acknowledge with humility the paradoxical nature of how powerful we are as creators, yet how uncontrollable the great Mystery really is. May those who read this book step fully into their power, their hearts, and their integrity, and may the world be blessed by how this book affects you."
— Lissa Rankin, M.D., New York Times best-selling author of Mind Over Medicine

Dawson Church
Dawson Church is a researcher and the author of several award-winning science books. His best-seller Mind to Matter demonstrates the connection between our inner thoughts and outer reality. Bliss Brain shows how elevated emotional states shape the anatomy of our brains. The Genie in Your Genes was the first book on epigenetics to describe how our emotions influence gene expression.
Research teams led by Dawson have published many clinical trials. His studies with veterans have shown that, using advanced psychological methods, over 80% recover from PTSD. MRI, EEG and gene trials have shown that his stress-management techniques regulate brain function and gene expression.

This book is dense. You may have to take notes. But I enjoyed the richness and plethora of interconnected facts that’s laid out. I have been on the subconscious journey and this is my 5th book on this topic. This book fills a number of gaps that books such as power of subconscious mind or power of visualization skimp on.

This is not a faith based book. It talks at a higher dimension, the plane of spirituality. For folks that seek a metaphysical and scientific underpinning for God, therapy and miracles this book is a good starting point.

Can this be condensed. Yes. But that I think was not the purpose. I felt the goal here was to convince the skeptics, the scientists, engineers, doctors who are so used to dealing with the measurable universe that there is a world that exists beyond the reach of current understanding of physics. If you (like me) seek and struggle with that, this is a good starting point.

Furnishing a new Home with Synchronicities
Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on September 13, 2018

This is a great book! I have been participating for quite some time in group meditation. I find mediation is often enhanced in a group setting.
I had just manifested a new home for my husband and I to move into. It is a magnificent 4 bedroom house verses a one bedroom apartment. We finally have room to breath and grow!
In that first inkling of getting the upgrade I began fantasizing about furniture for the new place. I thought I would like a nice fluffy white couch or chair to lounge on please. I looked a pictures and fantasized as I had absolutely no money to do a thing about it. 2 days later I got an email from my new landlord asking me if I would like to own a white leather couch for free... just go pick it up. Perfect! I thought... thank you universe!
I knew I needed to ask divine to help me manifest some more furniture, there was no way to afford all the the extra furnishings. As I went to another group meditation, we were asked to focus on our intent and mine was gratitude for the new house and some more furnishings.
I specifically said in my meditation, “ Look, I don't even know if I know how to really really dip into the field of abundance. I don't know if I really know how to ask, so I will tell you what, what ever it is I asked for? Triple that!” And I did an over and out mic drop to the divine and came out of the meditation.
The following day a woman walked into my office for some healing work. I casually mentioned I had been looking for a second couch as the house was big enough for 2. She said, I have a couch I want to get rid of. “Oh!” I said, “ I'll take it!” She said, “Don't you want to see if first? “ “Sure of course I do.” I replied. She then said “ Well, it's a 2 piece.” “Okay”, I nodded. She opened her phone and showed me a picture not of a sectional, but of 2 identical couches. Both white, with gold thread and in excellent condition.

Way to go self I thought! Ha!!! I have tested my ability to get in the manifestation zone.. I now have 3 couches. Well, it didn't stop there. The same woman needed to jettison some things. Some lovely and elegant things. I wound up with a home and kitchen full of absolutely high class furnishings. Too many to list here in fact. I actually had to jettison some things as well as a result. Now I have first hand experience with what abundance in manifestation means. It was truly an eye opening experience.

The only thing left I wanted was a new bed frame, which magically appeared within a month, also for free. I responded with right timing to a friend's facebook post! Solid oak with mirrors, drawers and shelves. It even has an electric outlet and a reading light that dims. Its absolutely beautiful! Not only was I provided for with abundance but the divine thought of all the bells and whistles for me once again. I am grateful for my more luxurious life every day!

Thank you Dawson for asking us to share our stories of synchronicities!

Far more important than being the best seller it is sure to be
Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on June 15, 2018

Dawson Church will surely sell a gazillion books. I wonder, however, if this book will actually get the attention it deserves.

It’s really two books, not back to back, but intertwined throughout.

The first is the New Age manifesto that will surely appeal to his large following. “From that place in consciousness, you live a life of wisdom, intelligence, and love. You no longer ask for love, need love, or crave love, because you are love.” For those who aren’t currently aware of Church (I was not) or haven’t signed onto the language of the genre, unfortunately, this might cause them to put the book down (I almost did). The genre suffers from a perceived lack of authenticity in some quarters simply because the language tends to the flowery.

That would be a shame.

Church is a scientist and offers an abundance of scientific evidence to support his contentions, the primary one being that “mind creates matter” and the second being that our consciousness is somehow universal, not individual. “The entire universe may be self-aware.” I readily accept both, even more so after reading this book.

Church claims that science is the new mysticism, suggesting that science has validated many beliefs that have been around for thousands of years. And that, too, is true. In doing that, however, Church has made an even more important contribution. He has clearly articulated the limitations of science. “What we find when we examine the way science is conducted is that for better or for worse, it is heavily influenced by belief. The ideal of the scientist as an objective assessor of facts is at odds with reality.”

We live in the age of science. Of that there is little doubt. We have raised the scientific worldview to religious status. In the process, however, we have lost sight of context, which, as Church points out, is always critical. We have lost, as the Chinese philosophers might say, our sense of balance. When we isolate science from context we aren’t revealing knowledge, we are dumbing it down to meet the constraints of science as we have come to understand it.

Church rightfully points out that once mainstream science spills over into the conceptual universe in which he participates, it will be the scientists themselves who resist the most ardently. They, having built their reputations and careers on a model of reality that is not quite accurate, will feel the most threatened.

Having said that, my only reservation about the book is that Church did not really help us to understand what those arguments are. There are undoubtedly skeptics about the science he offers. If there weren’t then this would be the biggest cover-up in the history of humanity. Many of the stories he shares are so overwhelming that it would be unthinkable that all of science hasn’t embraced them.

So I, for one, would like to understand what the skeptics have to say. Not because I think they can undermine what Church says here, but because I believe that would reinforce what I believe is the truth in Church’s assertions. Perhaps, however, that is for another book.

In the meantime, this is a marvelous book. And my advice, particularly if you are not inclined toward New Age thinking (those people will read it anyway), is to most definitely read it. It is well written and very well informed. I only wish he had chosen a different cover. This one, I believe, just doesn’t do justice to just how paradigm-shattering his observations are.

If you dream of living a happy, fulfilling life then you’ve got to read this book.
Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on July 23, 2018

At this time, when everything around us seems to be going topsy-turvy and we feel there is nothing we, as an individual, can do about it, just stop whatever you are doing. Get your hands on a copy, find a comfortable chair in a place where you won’t be disturbed for a while, take a few deep breaths, relax your body, open your mind and prepare to be fascinated.
This book will take you on an exciting voyage of discovery. A journey into your own, previously unseen, often misunderstood inner depths. It’s a journey every conscious human being needs to take if they want to fulfil their potential, but it is one that is much more difficult without this book to guide you.
In the past, the prospect of trying to understand how our own mind works could be scary simply because, at that stage, it was beyond our understanding. Dawson Church completely dispels any such fear or anxiety. He’s done extensive research, over many years, as the foundation for this book. He also presents research gathered from many of the leading scientists in the fields of neuroscience and energy management.
Yet it is not a difficult, scientific read. It is full of interesting charts, illustrations and case studies plus each of its seven chapters come with helpful exercises and links to additional internet-based resources. I admit the idea of case studies tended to put me off buying the book. But when I watched a webinar in which Dawson introduced his book, curiosity got the better of me and I’m so glad it did. The case studies really helped me gain a far better understanding of his subject and the benefits such an understanding can provide.
If you are a curious soul, let Dawson carefully guide you through the facts in the book to better understand yourself and your potential as a human being. He shows you what you need to know about being your whole self. How your mind, brain, body and energy can all work together to give you the happy, fulfilling life you long for. One in which you can share your gifts helping make life a better experience for others as well as yourself.
At this present time, when the lives of so many of us are being disrupted by forces seemingly beyond our own control, Dawson’s research clearly reveals how much the state of our own mind influences the way we function. These revelations offer the opportunity for every one of us to develop a far greater awareness and appreciation of our own capability to consciously and coherently influence our own actions. Developing this greater awareness will naturally lead to better life experiences for those around us as well as for our self.
What if all the disruption we are experiencing in the world is nature’s way of offering humanity a great opportunity? Disruption can provide the motivational force we need to reach out for a new level of self-awareness that will take us into realms of possibility we cannot even imagine from where we are now.
For too long, I’ve been teetering on the edge of participating in this great evolutionary leap now being offered to humanity. What has been holding me back? A distinct fear that I might be ‘burned at the stake’ for sharing my ideas about what we humans are, why we have consciousness and particularly self-awareness. Although I know I am only thinking metaphorically, the power of that thought has had the force to hold me back, until now, until I looked inside Dawson’s book. Its clarity contributes enormously to the rapid evolution in human understanding currently taking place, the evolution of our understanding of ourselves and our human nature.
If you want to be inspired and encouraged to become more consciously aware of how you ‘work’ and of how that greater awareness can lead you to live a more fulfilling life in these challenging times, then read this book!
Thank you so much Dawson, for all the time and effort you have invested in producing this book. Most of all, thank you for caring so much about the future of humanity that you’ve given us a book that is a such a joyful, exciting and stimulating read.

THE PERFECT PIECES TO COMPLETE MY JIGSAW
Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on August 6, 2018
Verified Purchase
I experienced a spectrum of beyond-the-norm phenomena during my life - including pre-birth memory, awareness of healing energy, precognition, sudden realisations in childhood that I was not this body, clairvoyance and clairaudience, channelling and ultimately, a full spiritual awakening. I always understood WHAT these happening were and WHY but searched and searched to know HOW they could occur. I knew my mind was at the centre of it all and the missing pieces of my jigsaw fell into place when I read this book. The clear explanations and detailed research evidence provided the context in which all my experiences made complete sense. I would recommend Mind to Matter to anyone who wants to know who they are and how to harness the power within.

A Compelling Collection of Scientific Evidence That’ll Make Even The Most Cynical Sceptic At Least Question What Is Possible
Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on June 19, 2018

This is a great book that will satisfy the desire of your emotional brain for solutions to help ease your inner turmoil AND feed the cravings of your rational brain for the proof to back them up.

It gets a bit deep in places and some of the science takes a few reads to at least try and understand. However it is a thoroughly well researched book by a respected scientist, researcher and practitioner. There are however lots of stories and case studies alongside the science that make it a more than enjoyable read.

If you are on your own personal path of self discovery and rejuvenation, Mind to Matter is a book that will help you take at least a few more steps on your journey.

At the very least, if you are not aware of it, the introduction to EFT is worth the price alone.

We are all aware of the fact that our emotions and thoughts affect our dreams, specifically the content of our dreams. The truth is that our dreams exist in our minds. Even Arjuna has stated in Bhagwad Gita, an ancient book of Hinduism that the “mind is as difficult to control as the wind.”
It is one of the best examples I could provide to explain mind over matter in this blog.
Arjuna explained that with the indifference of world objects and practices, the human mind could be controlled. When someone goes through stress, the brain generates stress responses, which is a full-body phenomenon.
Similarly, when someone experiences a real or imagined threat, the brain produces stress hormones that make the heart pound, breathing quicken, and muscles tense. This phenomenon can be referred to as Mind over matter. In this blog, we are going to discuss what is mind over matter and the psychology related to it with the help of examples.
What is Mind over Matter in Psychology?
To keep it simple, mind over matter is a term used to refer the capacity to accomplish results. Through this blog, I am going to tell you about the examples of mind over matter. Most of us are not aware of the mind over matter or power of the mind. More precisely, mind over matter is to unleash the infinite powers of the brain to conquer limitations and challenge the authenticities.
Do you know that our mind is so capable that it can move a mountain? No, right! Because most of us underestimate the power of our minds, we most of the time fail to see the perspective of our wills. Unknowingly, we sometimes achieve the unachievable, and sometimes we underestimate even after knowing our willpower. The fact is that our mind has the great power of surpassing reality and influencing reality.
In the next section, let’s understand mind over matter with the help of examples.
Examples of Mind Over Matter
1. Willpower
In some situations, we want to give up; however, when the mind takes control over the will, we get up and try to achieve the impossible. There are various stories of people who have achieved the impossible and unachievable by just leading a healthy life like us. Therefore, we should also train our minds never to give up and keep trying.
2. Stephen Hawking
Stephen Hawking is a worldwide famous personality who was diagnosed with motor neuron disorder during his 20’s. Regardless of his disorder, he never gave up and overcame the physical deformation and became one of the theoretical physicists. The important thing is that he had the willpower to find the way out of his issues, and he made technology his aid.
3. William Ernst Henley
William is a famous poet who wrote Invictus. In his poem, the poets talked about the experience of unleashed mental power and belief. The poets refused to get his leg to amputate, and with the help of other healthcare workers, he saved his leg. The firm belief and his conviction saved his leg, which shows that willpower is the only that helps endure the hardships.
4. Telekinesis
Telekinesis is the capability of moving something using your mind, without any application of physical force. Telekinesis is the best example of mind over matter. For example, the book named Maltida, wherein the protagonist is shown with telekinetic power.
5. The PK Man: A True Story of mind over matter
The PK Man is a book written by John E. Mack, and Jeffrey Mishlove is based on a real story of famous Ted Owens. Ted Owens made various absurd claims of superpowers to rule nature forces and the cause of natural disasters. Additionally, the author of the book is a parapsychologist who describes the viability of the book. If you want to read about mind over matter, I suggest you read the book.
6. Prayer and Meditation
The power of prayer and meditation is a continuous practice, and eventually, it increases mental strength. If you want to achieve greater control over self, you should try the power of prayer and meditation. Indian meditation and yoga help in the liberation of mind and help to realize the true selves.
7. Moksha
Moksha is an Indian word that means the destruction of meditative powers that frees the body from gravity. Additionally, Tibetan monks are referred to as the ones who control the temperature of the body to use the meditative techniques properly.
8. Placebo and Nocebo Effects
Placebo and Nocebo is an exciting phenomenon wherein placebos are not pills treatment, but placebos are for those patients who do not know that they are unreal. Since the human mind believes that the medicines are curative, they serve as a positive effect on the health of the patients. This phenomenon is known as the placebo effect.
The Nocebo effect means the creation of an opposite reaction in the patient’s mind wherein the patient starts feeling that the pills are harmful to the body. Placebo and Nocebo effects are purely psychological.
9. Hypnotherapy
Hypnotherapy is one of the famous therapies for taking control of the mind. Hypnotherapy is based on mind over matter concept which recovers the patient from psychological disorders and specific ailments. The ailments get treated when the mind changes the behavioral aspects. In this way, the hypnotherapy takes control of the body and mind of the patient.
10. Self-motivation
Confidence and self-believe lead to achieving something impossible, and this phenomenon is known as self-motivation. Encouragement of thoughts boosts the capability of attaining something impossible. To realize your goals, it is essential to have faith and believe. When you have faith and belief, the difficulties or circumstances cannot come in between as obstacles.
11. Overcoming pain
Overcoming pain is one of the mental techniques to heal the patient. Some researches show that we can reduce the chronic pain of the human body with the use of mental power. With concentration and meditation, we can ease the pain of the human body, but this requires the ultimate level of concentration and mind control.
12. Walking over hot coal
Walking over hot coal is also one of the famous examples of mind over matter. Walking over hot coal is also known as firewalking. Studies show that less contact time with hot coals does not cause any pain, and the skin does not burn.
Note: Do not attempt this at home. We have just used this as an example.
10 Ways to Practice Mind Over Matter
1. Start exercising
Research shows that physical activities also take care of our mental health and prevent our bodies from various disorders. Therefore, keep exercising.
2. Keep connected with your social network
I am not talking about the online connection here; I am referring to the real connection. Therefore, keep a connection with your friends and family members as they will prevent your body from loneliness and isolation.
3. Take proper intake of veggies and fruits
In order to stay active mentally and physically, keep taking the proper amount of veggies and fruits as they help in maintaining the cholesterol and blood sugar levels.
4. Try mental flossing
Deep sleep is basically the best way to floss mentally. It helps in improving mental and physical wellbeing.
5. Keep learning new things
They say that there is no age to learn new things. Therefore, keep learning new things as it will help you in building resilience.
6. Start meditating
Meditation is not a sci-fi thing that could not be achieved easily. All you have to do is to sit quietly and be in the present. You can also try simple breathing exercises and other forms of meditation.
7. Use your Visualization power
If you really want to achieve success at mind over matter, start visualizing. Visualization will help in reaching your desired goal or result. Read More about visualization techniques here.
8. Set and track your goals
By focusing on your goals you will be able to overcome your obstacles and mind over matter. Therefore, start searching for your purpose in life and start working on it.
9. Keep talking to yourself
If you keep talking to yourself and feel like it’s not the right thing to do then you might be wrong here. positive self-talk helps in increasing self-esteem and helps in removing negative thoughts as well.
10. AdaptAdopt habits that inspire you
You can try the 21/90 rule to adopt healthy habits. You can also adopt habits that inspire you to do something better in life.
Final Thoughts:
Our Mind is mostly underestimated by most of us. mind over matter is a strong and powerful Practice we all have. It can be easily achieved with determination, positivity, better health, a more solid-state, the ability to build mental will, and turning our focus and concentration.
Mind over matter should be practiced by all of us and it should be taught to the youth more importantly. With the help of all of these factors, we will be able to build a better future, and more importantly, we will be able to learn how to be mindful and how we can appreciate the present moment.
I hope this blog helped you to understand what mind over matter is and their related to psychology. We would love to hear from you, comment down and let us know what mind over matter means to you. For more such content, connect with us on all social media platforms.

What is the relation between mind and Matter?
Your mind, or consciousness, is a process constantly maintained by your brain. Your brain is, of course, an organ composed of matter. The energy required for this activity is provided by your body in the form of digested food + inhaled oxygen.
Your mind receives information from the many sensory organs in your body, plus a few chemicals from your endocrine system (glands). In turn, your mind controls, mostly via nerves, the functions of your (material) body, both voluntary and involuntary. Via your hands and other parts of your body, you are able to have effects on material objects around you.

Abstract
The relationship of mind and matter is approached in a new way in this article. This approach is based on the causal interpretation of the quantum theory, in which an electron, for example, is regarded as an inseparable union of a particle and afield. This field has, however, some new properties that can be seen to be the main sources of the differences between the quantum theory and the classical (Newtonian) theory. These new properties suggest that the field may be regarded as containing objective and active information, and that the activity of this information is similar in certain key ways to the activity of information in our ordinary subjective experience. The analogy between mind and matter is thus fairly close. This analogy leads to the proposal of the general outlines of a new theory of mind, matter, and their relationship, in which the basic notion is participation rather than interaction. Although the theory can be developed mathematically in more detail, the main emphasis here is to show qualitatively how it provides a way of thinking that does not divide mind from matter, and thus leads to a more coherent understanding of such questions than is possible in the common dualistic and reductionistic approaches. These ideas may be relevant to connectionist theories and might perhaps suggest new directions for their development.

Mind and Matter
George Frederick Stout
1919 to 1921
University of Edinburgh
The first volume of Stout’s Gifford Lecture series, Mind and Matter, is a metaphysical treatise intended to clear the way for the second series, entitled God and Nature. In the book one he explores the metaphysical difficulties surrounding two of the most fundamental questions of philosophy: the existence of the mind and existence of the material world. Determining that most metaphysical theories are inadequate for this purpose, Stout ultimately concludes the necessity of enlisting ‘Common Sense’. He suggests, however, that this is made possible by an ‘Animism of Common Sense’ pervasive in the world and embodied in both animals and humans.
The second book of Mind and Matter seeks to address the relationship between mind and the matter. For Stout, Interactionism, Parallelism and Materialism are all insufficient philosophical theories for explaining this relationship. He argues that mind cannot be the product of matter because: it ‘is against the scientific concept of the Order of Nature as a system of laws’; scientific theory requires ‘continuance of the producing factors in a product’; and, finally, there is evidence of will affecting matter—if matter produced mind, mind could not dictate the action of matter. He further argues that no scientific explanation sufficiently explains the dual nature in which the self is conscious of itself, both as existing within a body and as existing among other bodies. Only a philosophical explanation may even approach an adequate discernment as to the relationship between mind and matter, and relationship between the individual and the universal mind he sees as pervasive in nature.
Books three and four address the persisting question of knowledge of existence. Stout assesses four types of theory regarding knowledge of existence, finding Idea-Theories, Sensation-Theories, Appearance-Theories and Kant’s ‘empirical self’ insufficient. He argues ‘a fundamental fallacy’ in all views that may be called subjective, ‘because they are founded on the assumption that the course of our existence might be such as it is, whether a physical world exists or not’. For Stout, existence can only be known through experience, although the reality of that which is being experienced may not be known. That is to say, the process of experiencing is what gives evidence of existence, not that which is being experienced. The author argues the only theory that gives certainty to existence is ‘Common Sense’. Although this is not a perfect tool, it is capable of being ‘measured by its power to maintain itself by adaptive transformation throughout the successive stages of relative ignorance and enlightenment’. Moreover, it can be gauged by consensus, although it necessarily must be put to the philosopher’s ‘own independent scrutiny—if, in particular, he finds that it is required for a coherent view of the nature of the universe as a whole—then for him it is finally established’. This intelligence of a common sense stems from the union of body and mind in self-consciousness, a self-consciousness that is attentive to the ‘animism of common sense’ which is the result of a Mind pervasive in nature. This is possible because the mind is not derived from matter; it merely functions alongside it. Not being derived from matter, the mind is ‘ultimate and fundamental in the constitution of the Universe of Being’. Thus, the human mind is the finite embodiment of a greater Mind. Here Stout begins to move towards the theistic ontology that he will purport in his second series of lectures. For Stout, the Universe of Being, ‘whatever it is, must be an eternal and universal Mind, giving to Nature, through and through, a character which is inexplicable’.

1.  Mind and Matter
We begin with our journey with an examination of the relationship between conscious minds and physical matter (traditionally called the “mind-body problem”).
Historical Roots
Before launching into a discussion of modern views on the mind-body problem, it is helpful to consider the historical processes that gave rise to those views. In particular, an historical perspective will enable us to understand the almost religious vehemence with which some positions are held.
In the history of human thought up until surprisingly recent times, it was much more common to attribute mental or psychological properties to seemingly inanimate matter than it is today. Jonathan Shear, the founder and editor of the Journal of Consciousness Studies, notes that the problem of accounting for the existence of conscious experience that confronts modern science was not a problem for the ancient Greeks, as they viewed the material world as being imbued with mind, which served as a force governing the behavior of matter (Shear, 1995).  For instance, Thales of Miletus (died c. 546 B.C.E.) claimed that inanimate objects possessed a psyche allowing them the possibility of self-motion.  A century later Empedocles asserted that all elemental bodies were endowed with thought and sensation (Nash, 1995a).  Epicurus (341-271 B.C.E.) held that atoms have free will and could initiate collisions by swerving from their path, which was believed to be predetermined by such atomists as Democritus and Leucippus (Skrbina, 2005).  This idea has been revitalized many times over the course of development of Western thought.  Even as late as the turn of the last century, Ernst Haeckel (1899/1929) argued that in order for molecules to be attracted to one another, each must somehow “feel” each other’s presence.
 Aristotle taught that the natural state of any body was one of rest.  He asserted that the crystalline spheres which carried the planets and stars on their celestial voyages in his cosmology were associated with incorporeal “movers” that provided the force needed to maintain their motion.  He viewed these movers as being spiritual in nature and conceived of the relation of a mover to its sphere as “akin to that of a soul to its body” (Mason, 1962, p. 42).
Aristotle’s view was given a Christian interpretation by Christian philosophers such as Dionysius in the fifth century and Thomas Aquinas in the thirteenth century, with Aristotle’s “movers” being equated with the angels described in the Scriptures.  Aristotle also attributed psychological properties to baser matter, ascribing the tendency for a terrestrial object to fall to the Earth to its “aspiration” to reach its natural place.
Even as late as 1600, William Gilbert, an English physician and the founder of the scientific study of magnetic phenomena, proclaimed that the Earth has a magnetic soul analogous to the “magnetic soul” that Gilbert believed governed the behavior of lodestones. According to Gilbert, the rotation of the Earth and the inclination of its axis of rotation with respect to the sun were both caused by a desire on the part of the Earth’s soul to avoid extreme temperatures and to cause seasonal variations.  Almost two centuries later, in 1777, the English chemist Joseph Priestley asserted that physical matter was akin to “spiritual and immaterial beings” because of its properties of attraction and repulsion.
  These animistic views of matter gradually crumbled under the onslaught of scientific advances. The law of the conservation of angular momentum (earlier called the doctrine of “impetus”) led John Philoponos in the sixth century and William of Ockham in the fourteenth to deny the need to assume the existence of angels to keep the planetary spheres in motion. After all, if you spin a top, it keeps spinning by itself. (Philoponos was rewarded for this observation by being denounced as a heretic by the Church.)  
In rejecting Aquinas’ angels, William of Ockham was led to formulate his famous injunction “not to multiply entities beyond necessity,” which has since become known as “Ockham’s Razor.”  In fact, Ockham’s Razor, which was originally formulated to justify the exclusion of a class of spiritual beings (Aristotle’s angelic movers) is still one of the primary justifications used by modern scientists and philosophers to deny the existence of a realm of mental experience that is independent of physical events in the brain.  With regard to Ockham’s original application of his principle, the historian of science Herbert Butterfield (1957) viewed the impetus doctrine (in the form of the modern laws of conservation of momentum) as the primary factor underlying the banishment of a spiritual realm from scientific accounts of the world and the establishment in seventeenth century of the view of the universe as material clockwork-like mechanism.  The Calvinist John Preston proclaimed in 1628 that “God alters no law of Nature” (Mason, 1962, p. 181).  Divine intervention by deities or angels was no longer permitted; events were seen to be predictable from, and governed by, the laws of nature alone.   
 Vestiges of divine intervention persisted at least into the 18th century. Issac Newton asserted that divine intervention was necessary to reestablish the regular order of the planets’ orbits, which were constantly being deranged due to gravitational forces among the planets and comets and to a supposed gradual reduction in orbital velocity due to “ether drag” (Christianson, 1978).  However, in general the picture of the universe that emerged from the seventeenth century (at least in Western philosophy) was one of a huge impersonal machine governed by strictly mechanical principles.
Once the picture of the physical universe as a soulless machine gained ascendancy, not only did matter get stripped of its mental and spiritual aspects, so did living organisms. For instance, while Ernest Haeckel used an analogy between the growth of salt crystals and that of living cells to proclaim that all matter had a spiritual aspect, his contemporary Carl Nageli used precisely the same analogy to deny that biological cells were associated with a spiritual force, instead arguing that their growth was due to simple mechanical forces. The chemical synthesis of organic compounds in the laboratory, exemplified by Friederich Wöhler’s synthesis of urea in 1828, further undermined the vitalistic philosophies that insisted that a spiritual force governed biological processes.
Antoine Lavoisier had earlier demonstrated that the ratio of emitted heat to carbon dioxide was the same for candle flames as it was for animals, suggesting that respiration was a purely mechanical process.
While vitalism is not dead, its few modern advocates, including Arthur Koestler (1972, 1978) have been regarded as fringe thinkers by the scientific establishment.   
One of the contributors to this mechanistic cosmology was, paradoxically enough, the seventeenth century philosopher and mathematician Rene Descartes, who is widely regarded as being the prototype of the modern dualist (a dualist being one who regards the realms of mind and matter as having independent reality).  Among the phenomena that had most strongly indicated a mental aspect to matter were those suggestive of the operation of action-at-a-distance, such as gravitation and magnetism.  Descartes was able to eliminate this stumbling block on the road to a totally mechanistic outlook by proposing theories of magnetism (the vortex theory) and gravitation (the plenum theory) that avoided the problem of action-at-a-distance by assuming that these two types of force were transmitted through a physical medium.
Descartes extended his mechanistic philosophy to encompass living creatures as well as inanimate matter. He viewed animals as mere machines.  He did not, however, question the existence of minds in humans; indeed, he thought one’s primary and most direct knowledge was of one’s own mind. He viewed mind as a totally different kind of entity from matter. In Descartes’ view, one’s mind (or ego) was indivisible and hence lacked a basic character of matter—that of extension in space.  Thus, the mind inhabited a different plane of existence from the physical world and could not be said to have a spatial location.
Despite their different natures, Descartes proposed that the mind interacted with the physical body by deflecting the motion of the “animal spirits” flowing through the brain. He thought the pineal gland was the area of the brain in which this mind-matter interaction took place (as the pineal gland was the one structure that was not duplicated in the cerebral hemispheres and thus seemed appropriate to house a unitary and indivisible mind).  Because Descartes’ law of inertia held merely that the total quantity of motion in a system remains constant (but not necessarily its direction), he proposed that the soul acted upon the body by altering the direction of motion of the animal spirits, while not changing the intensity of that motion. 
The mathematician G. W. Leibniz, however, demonstrated that Descartes was in error and that directionality was conserved in the law of momentum.  Thus, Leibniz demonstrated that the physical body (as modeled by Descartes) was a deterministic system. There was therefore no room left for an influence of the mind on the body, and the mind was totally excluded from influence on the physical world. (It should be noted that mind retained a place in Leibniz’ own “monad” cosmology, although that cosmology never gained ascendancy in Western thought.)
As a deterministic clockwork physical universe allows no room for mind-action, it is not surprising that Cartesian dualism soon yielded to the materialism of Hobbes and La Mettrie (and more recently of Watson, Skinner, Dennett and the Churchlands). 
Once again, an application of the law of inertia led to the exclusion of the spiritual realm from scientific models of the world, only this time it was not angels being banished from the heavens, but the human soul itself being banished from its body. Indeed the historian of science Richard Westfall (1977) viewed the rigid exclusion of the psychic from physical nature as the “permanent legacy” of the seventeenth century.
However, since the emergence of the theory of quantum mechanics early in the last century, the brain is no longer viewed as a deterministic system. Thus, the argument from determinism no longer works, and there is now the possibility that an immaterial mind could interact with a physical brain by selecting which quantum state the brain enters out of the many states that are possible at any given time. 
The philosopher Michael Lockwood (1989) has noted that the prejudice in favor of matter was grounded in the apparent solidity of the former in the Newtonian worldview. Lockwood points out that the solidity of matter has disappeared in the theory of quantum mechanics (material particles exist as probability waves in an abstract mathematical space until they are observed) and that mind and matter are now both equally mysterious.
The tenacity with which some scientists resist the idea of an autonomous realm of mind is perhaps understandable in light of history. The emerging mechanistic picture of the world was fiercely resisted by the religious establishment, notable examples being the condemnation of Galileo for the crime of propounding the heliocentric (sun-centered) model of the solar system and the resistance to the theory of biological evolution that is still being mounted by Christian fundamentalists. Thus, any mention of an immaterial soul may raise fears of a descent back into religious irrationalism (and a consequent lack of funding) on the part of many scientists.
Edge (2002a) in fact attributes Descartes’ proposal of his theory of mind-matter interaction in part to his desire to remove the authority of the Church over the scientific investigation of matter.  Edge notes that science could only investigate matter with the tools available in the seventeenth century and that it was (and still is) “not equipped” to deal with mentalistic phenomena.   Edge (2002b) also attributes science’s embrace of the ancient Greek philosophy of atomism (in which the universe is conceived as being composed of microscopic, discrete elementary particles) as another move to reject, or circumvent, the authority of the Church.   
Let us now turn to an examination of modern views on, and “solutions” of, the mind-brain problem.
Monistic Philosophies
Monistic solutions to the mind-brain problem are those that postulate that the universe is composed of only one type of “stuff.” That “stuff” is usually taken to be mind, matter, or some sort of “tertium quid” having both mental and physical properties. Monism stands in contrast to dualism and pluralism, which comprise those philosophical positions that postulate the existence of two or more distinctly different types of “stuff,” with one of them typically being mind and another being matter.
Idealism. The monistic position that contends that the world is composed solely of minds and mental events goes by the name of idealism.  According to idealists, all that exists is mental experience. People consciously or unconsciously construct the hypothesis of a physical world in order to account for certain regularities in their sensory experience, but this is only a convenient fiction. The contention that the physical world may be an illusion is logically irrefutable.  For instance, you may think you are a human being holding a book on the mind-brain problem in your hand, whereas in fact you may be a nucleon-based life form on the surface of a neutron star who has gone into the analogue of a movie theater where strong pion fields have been applied to your brain both to induce amnesia for your real existence and to create in you the illusion that you are some two-legged elongated oxygen-breathing carbon-based being on a remote planetary body for the sole purposes of entertainment.  More simply, you could be merely dreaming or hallucinating. Following the Taoist philosopher Chuang Tzu, the reader might legitimately wonder whether she or he might be a butterfly temporarily dreaming about being a human being reading a sentence about butterfly dreams. I can remember arguing with someone against this position. I maintained that I could not be dreaming because of the clarity and consistency of my sensory experience. Imagine my surprise when I woke up. (This actually happened to me.)
All you can be certain of is your own existence. Seeking certain knowledge, Descartes found that he could not doubt his own existence as a thinking being.  In perhaps his most famous quote, he was led to exclaim, “I think, therefore I am.” All you can be absolutely certain of is your own existence and that you are now thinking certain thoughts, remembering certain memories, feeling certain feelings and sensing certain sensations. The inferences you make about your external environment based on these mental events may not be valid, as you may be hallucinating, remembering falsely, having groundless feelings and thinking delusional thoughts. The doctrine that only one’s self exists or can be proven to exist is a special case of idealism that goes by the name of solipsism.
  The various agencies presumed by idealists to be responsible for producing the illusion of the physical world have included God (in the view of the prototypical idealist, the eighteenth century philosopher Bishop George Berkeley, for whom Berkeley University was named), a collective mind or collective unconscious, and the illusion-producing state of craving and ignorance (according to certain schools of Buddhism).
The reply of most modern scientists and philosophers of science to idealism is that scientific theories that postulate the existence of an objective physical world have produced more exact predictions about possible human observations than have idealistic theories and therefore should be preferred over the latter for that reason. (Such theories are even covertly preferred by most solipsists, who seem strangely reluctant to step in front of illusory oncoming trains. Dr. Samuel Johnson said of idealism, “I refute it thus,” and then he proceeded to kick a rock with his foot. Johnson’s “refutation,” while actually proving nothing, did show his dedication to the anti-idealist cause.)
Idealism is not merely an historical curiosity, but even has its advocates today. Within parapsychology, for instance, Edgar Mitchell (1979), a former Apollo astronaut who once walked on the moon, suggested that an idealistic philosophy may have to be adopted in order to account for the evidence for psychokinesis (the alleged ability of mind to directly influence material objects and systems that are remote from the body.)  The physicist Amit Goswami (1993) has contended that an idealist conception of the world is required in order to render modern theories of physics, in particular quantum mechanics, coherent.
Radical Materialism. Radical materialism is the polar opposite of idealism. Radical materialists deny the existence of mental events, insisting that the world of physical matter is the only reality.  Incredibly enough, this philosophy held sway in the discipline of psychology itself in the early part of this century (at least in the United States).  Behaviorism emerged as the dominant force in psychology in this country as a reaction against the fallibility of the method of introspection that predominated in the earliest days of psychological investigation. Behavior was publicly observable and scientifically measurable, whereas the vague mental images that form, say, a particular individual’s idea of the number seven are not. Some of the leaders of the behaviorist movement, such as John Watson (1924/1970) and the earlier versions of B. F. Skinner (e.g., Skinner, 1953), went so far as to deny the existence of mental events altogether.  This denial of course flies in the face of the fact that the reader and I (if I am not a figment of the reader’s imagination) have directly experienced such mental events as sensations, thoughts, feelings and memories. Skinner’s position essentially contains its own refutation. Skinner could not consistently claim that he believed that mental events do not exist, as that belief would itself constitute a mental event. Therefore by his own theory (and reportedly by his own contention), Skinner’s expressions of belief in the doctrine of radical materialism were merely forms of physical behavior than he had been rewarded for displaying in the past (through royalties, academic honoraria, etc.).  If the books produced by Skinner are in fact merely the product of conditioned typewriter-pecking responses and the sentences within them do not express ideas, there is no need to take these books seriously.  It should be noted that Skinner did eventually retreat from this early radical version of his theory.
Materialism is not dead as a philosophy in modern cognitive neuroscience, however. The philosopher Paul Churchland has recently proposed doing away with “folk psychology” (talk of mental events such as beliefs and desires) in all human discourse (Churchland, 1989, 1995).  He would replace “folk psychology” with a strictly neural account of behavior. Thus, instead of a wife telling her husband that she is really angry at him, she would say instead, “The neurons in my amygdala seem to be firing at an unacceptably high rate.”   
Churchland has in fact gone so far as to assert that truth might cease to be an aim of science! This assertion is implicitly based on the assumption that the concept of truth presupposes the existence of propositions capable of being true or false, which in turn presupposes the existence of mental events such as thoughts, ideas and beliefs that are expressed in such propositions. Churchland proposes that scientific theories should no longer be expressed in terms of sentences but rather in terms of patterns of connections among neurons (or among the pseudoneurons in a computerized “neural net,” as discussed below). But now we are right back where we started. Unless human knowledge is to be given up entirely, Churchland must at least be able to entertain propositions such as “neural net A diagnoses diseases more accurately than does neural net B.” Such propositions, however express beliefs. If Churchland seriously wishes to give up the “folk psychological” concept of belief, then his philosophy self-destructs in the same way that Skinner’s did.
Skinner, incidentally, was by no means the last modern thinker to deny the very existence of private conscious experience, or “qualia” in the terminology of philosophers. The prominent materialist philosopher Daniel Dennett has asserted that “contrary to what seems obvious at first blush, there simply are no qualia at all” (Dennett, 1988, p. 74).  This statement may go a long way toward explaining Dennett’s reasoning.  However, I imagine that reader (like me) has personally experienced a great number of qualia, such as brilliant patches of red and pangs of hunger.  Qualia may be both beautiful and horrifying.  Dennett doesn’t know what he is missing.
Quasi-dualistic materialism. More sensible versions of materialism concede the existence of mental events, but contend that mental events arise solely from physical events and that a complete scientific description of the world can be given in terms of physical processes alone. In one version of this theory, mental events are thought to be brain events experienced from the “inside.” This view goes by the names “central state materialism” and “neural identity” theory, among others. A related doctrine is double-aspect theory. Double-aspect theorists contend that mental and physical events are merely two aspects of a single underlying reality. As the vast majority of double-aspect theorists implicitly or explicitly assume that this single underlying reality is essentially physical matter, this theory is basically equivalent to the previous two. 
Panpsychism.  A similar doctrine is panpsychism, which asserts that all matter, not just living organisms, has a mental aspect.  This view has been advocated by the prominent Western philosopher Alfred North Whitehead (1929/1978), among others.  
Panpsychism, with its contention that rocks and toothbrushes enjoy some form of consciousness, strikes one as absurd at first brush (or even more clearly upon a secondary cursory inspection of one’s toothbrush).  However, when you carefully consider it, the doctrine begins to grow on you.  
A prominent recent proponent of this position is the philosopher David Ray Griffin (1988a, 1988b, 1994, 1997), although he prefers to call his doctrine “panexperientialism” rather than “panpsychism,” as he does not contend that rocks and other inanimate collections of material particles possess a highly unified and structured consciousness, but rather ascribes only vague “feeling-responses” to them.  More highly complex and structured forms of consciousness, in Griffin’s view are restricted to “compound individuals.”  Such compound individuals are composed of, or arise from, a hierarchical collection of more primitive selves or “individuals.”  For instance, a neuron would be a compound individual in relation to its individual constituents such as molecules, and a “suborgan” such as the hippocampus of the brain that is composed of neurons would be a compound individual somewhat further up the hierarchy.  All such “individuals” would have both mental and physical aspects under the panexperientialist view, although only hierarchically-ordered structures would be assumed to have a highly organized and structured consciousness.  Less well-organized structures, such as rocks, would be ascribed only vague “feeling responses” according to Griffin’s panexperientialist theory.   
David Skrbina (2003, 2005) has recently provided a comprehensive and brilliant defense of the doctrine of “panpsychism.”  Skrbina argues for instance that an electron must somehow sense the presence of a proton in order to respond to its attractive force.  (An electron may even enjoy a certain degree of freedom of action due to quantum indeterminacy and may be able to sense a quantum field that is highly complex and global in nature.)  
As does Griffin, Skrbina associates more complex forms of consciousness with aggregates of matter, such as single neurons, or large assemblies of neurons such as hippocampi and cerebral hemispheres.  (However, it should be noted that, as discussed in the previous chapter, such aggregates of matter, much like one’s personality and physical body, do not persist over time and thus cannot form the basis of a continuing self.  Also, fields of consciousness appear to be unitary and indivisible, much more like a quark than like a molecule or a neuron.)
 As Skrbina points out, the panpsychist position solves the problem of “emergence” or the need to account for how organisms acquired consciousness in the course of evolution (i.e., how insensate matter gave rise to consciousness).  As he notes, there is no definitive line of demarcation that can be drawn between conscious and nonconscious organisms, in either the present world or in the course of evolution.  If all matter is imbued with consciousness or if fields of consciousness are fundamental constituents of the universe that have existed throughout its history, then the problem of evolution of consciousness (and of how a three-pound “hunk of meat” like the human brain could generate conscious experiences in the first place) does not arise.
It should, however, be noted that panpsychism still faces the difficulty of accounting for the emergence of a unified mind and global consciousness out of a myriad of psychic elements, as was pointed out long ago by William James and, more recently, by William Seager (1995).
Epiphenomenalism.  Epiphenomenalism is technically a form of dualism, insofar as it grants separate reality to the realms of mind and matter; however, I will classify epiphenomenalism as a form of quasi-dualistic materialism, as it denies that mental events have any influence whatsoever on the physical world. Mental events are considered to be mere “epiphenomena” of physical events in the sense that, while mental events are caused by physical events, they are themselves incapable of causing or influencing physical events. A prominent advocate of epiphenomenalism was the biologist Thomas Henry Huxley (1874, 1877), the grandfather of the noted writer Aldous Huxley,  who was perhaps most noted for his tireless defenses of Darwin’s theory of evolution (so much so that he earned the nickname “Darwin’s Bulldog”).
  Several writers, including the noted mathematician Roger Penrose (1987b) and Karl Popper and John Eccles (1977) have noted that epiphenomenalism in fact goes counter to Darwinism. Why should a conscious mind have evolved, they ask, if it did not play an active role in benefiting the organism? 
Also, and perhaps most amusingly, the mere existence of epiphenomenalist theories is in itself sufficient to refute the doctrine of epiphenomenalism.  After all, epiphenomenalism was developed as an attempt to explicate the role of mental events; therefore, the theory has been created in response to (i.e., has been caused by) mental events; otherwise, epiphenomenalism could not claim to be a theory of mental experience.  Thus, the theory of epiphenomenalism is refuted by the fact of its own existence.  
The physicist Heinz Pagels (1988) raised the question of whether the universe could be a giant computer, much as a personal computer screen can become transformed into a mini-universe with quasi-organisms evolving on it when a program realizing mathematician John Conway’s “game of life” is run on it.  This idea had previously been suggested by Ed Fredkin of M.I.T. and explicitly endorsed by Tomasso Toffoli (1982).  This view has been most recently revived by the noted mathematician Stephen Wolfram (2002), who suggests that universe is best understood as a giant cellular automaton (computerized grid of cells following prescribed rules of behavior).  If this suggestion that the universe is in fact the product of a giant computer has any validity, we cannot equate ourselves with the godlike programmers who created the universe and assume that we have simply each become entranced in the life of one of our three-dimensional creations (which we have come to regard as our physical body). Because of the arguments against epiphenomenalism, we cannot be mere spectators in the world. Our consciousnesses have a more active role in the universe than that.   
Physicalism.  The philosophical positions that I have grouped together under the heading of quasi-dualistic materialism would seem to be equivalent to one another as scientific theories, insofar as they all apparently make the same scientific predictions (mainly that no violations of the known laws of physics will occur in the brain and that no successful predictions regarding the behavior of the brain can be generated from theories involving nonphysical entities such as souls or minds that could not in principle at least be derived from theories referring solely to physical entities and processes).
The empirical findings that most directly challenge the doctrine of physicalism derive from the parapsychologists’ investigations of ostensible psi phenomena such as the clairvoyant reading of ESP cards and psychokinetic influence of the fall of rolling dice.  Because of their importance in this debate and because of the controversies surrounding parapsychological research, these findings and their implications will be discussed in some detail in Chapters 3 through 5.  However, as we have seen in Chapter 0, this evidence is not needed in order to build a strong case that one’s individual self or consciousness is something other than one’s physical body and may be capable of surviving the death of that body, or (perhaps more likely) of departing the body and becoming associated with a new physical system well prior to the death of the body.   
It is commonly held, both by parapsychologists and skeptics, that psi phenomena are inexplicable on the basis of current physical theories and are thus evidence against the doctrine of physicalism, if the latter is construed as the contention that all phenomena can be ultimately accounted for in terms of present theories of physics or relatively minor extensions thereof.
 Joseph Banks Rhine (the researcher who is largely regarded as the progenitor of modern parapsychology and who established the first major research program in experimental parapsychology at Duke University in the 1930s) in particular was highly skeptical that psi phenomena could be explained on the basis of any physicalistic theory. In fact, Rhine suggested that psi was nonphysical in nature, due to the lack of dependence of experimental psi-scoring rates on spatial or temporal separations and the lack of attenuation of the psi signal by physical barriers between the percipient and the target object (e.g., ESP card or die) that would block most known forms of physical signals (such as electromagnetic radiation).  Rhine also cited the fact psi success appears to be independent of the physical nature of the target object, as well as the apparent backward causation in time involved in precognition (and, we might now add, retroactive psychokinesis), as further evidence against any physicalistic explanation of psi phenomena.  At one point, Rhine (1972) postulated the existence of “nonphysical energy” in order to explain psi, a concept that the noted dualist philosopher John Beloff considered to be oxymoronic (Beloff, 1981).
Michael Levin (2000) has made the argument that if psi abilities are based on physical processes grounded in the biomechanical properties of the body, then surely these abilities would be selected for in the process of evolution and would by now be readily apparent in animals’ behavior.  The fact psi is an elusive and rarely observed ability, Levin asserts, constitutes further evidence that it is not derived from the biomechanical workings of animals’ bodies. 
Because it appears to be difficult to account for psi phenomena on the basis of known physical theories or principles, it is often believed that the existence of psi phenomena would falsify physicalism (where “physicalism” denotes the class of theories encompassing radical materialism and quasi-dualistic materialism). As the vast majority of working scientists subscribe to some form of physicalistic solution to the mind-body problem, it should not be surprising that they would choose to reject the claims of parapsychology, insofar as those claims tend to threaten their worldview. 
Some of the resistance of establishment science toward accepting the existence of psi may stem back to the fact that Western science has relatively recently (in the vast scheme of things) emerged from a battle with the Church over who would hold the authority regarding determining the nature of reality, the trial of Galileo being only one prominent example.  There are those who believe that some sort of truce should be declared between science and religion, such as Stephen J. Gould, who asserted that science and religion should be considered as “separate magisteria,” with science holding reign over matters of empirical fact and religion holding reign over ethics and matters of the spirit (Gould, 1999).   However, despite Gould’s contentions, science and religion are in many cases still in conflict over empirical questions, as is evident in the ongoing battle of religious creationists in the United States to have Dawrwin’s theory of evolution either removed or downplayed in high school biology curricula.
This conflict continues to underlie much of the scientific establishment’s resistance toward accepting the findings of parapsychological investigations.    For instance, in a scathing attack on parapsychology, Nicholas Humphrey (1996) asserts that the questions of the existence of souls and of the existence of paranormal powers are not independent issues and that the possession of a soul would imply the existence of such powers. On the other side of the fence, as psi phenomena suggest the existence of a nonphysical aspect to the mind, many people who would prefer to believe in the existence of an immortal soul may tend to adopt a belief in psi phenomena in support of their position. Indeed, John Beloff (1983) even asserted, in a Presidential Address to the Parapsychological Association, that the existence of an afterlife is contingent on the existence of psi, in seeming agreement with Humphrey’s position.  This is undoubtedly too strong an assertion, however, as it is quite conceivable that a mind or soul (or more likely a field of pure consciousness) could survive death even if the living person (or surviving trace) did not possess the powers of ESP and PK.
Even if it is assumed that the explanation of psi phenomena will require the postulation of entities and principles beyond those currently known to physicalistic science, it may be a mere issue of terminology whether such entities are to be considered material or nonmaterial.  If the former, the physicalist can claim victory; if the latter, the dualist can claim the same. Obviously, if mind and matter interact, they form one united system.  Whether one chooses to call that system the physical universe may be a matter of semantics rather than substance. (Some of the theoretical concepts already employed by physicists, such as the quantum-mechanical wave function discussed in the next chapter, already seem more mind-like than material in any event.)
Strangely enough, J. B. Rhine himself disavowed any position of dualism. John Beloff (1981) traces Rhine’s eschewal of dualism to his difficulty in seeing how such dissimilar things as mind and matter could interact, although Beloff himself sees no reason why a cause must necessarily be of the same nature as its effect.   Beloff suggests that Rhine’s position may have been motivated by a desire to avoid charges of supernaturalism as well as a desire to leave the door open for an ultimate cosmology that would embrace both mind and matter.  Beloff notes that Rhine recognized that psi might potentially be given an explanation in terms of quantum mechanics and that Rhine only wished to state the incompatibility of psi with “conventional” physics. Interestingly enough, Frederick Dommeyer (1982) has classified Rhine as a double-aspect theorist, presumably referring to a version of double-aspect theory in which the common substance underlying mental and physical events is something other than matter as currently understood.  
Several other parapsychological theorists have proposed versions of the double-aspect theory. Edmund Gurney, one of the early pioneers of psychical research, proposed that some third form of existence or “tertium quid,” in addition to mind and matter, would be required in order to explain mental phenomena and to bridge the gap between mind and brain (Gurney, 1887).  In more recent times, Carroll Nash (1976, 1995b) has proposed a double-aspect theory to explain psi phenomena.  Nash proposes that mind and matter are each aspects of some tertium quid, or neutral substance, that is not governed by space, time or causality, thus allowing psi to occur (as well as providing the basis for mystical experiences). Nash’s theory does not, however, appear to be sufficiently developed to enable testable predictions to be derived from it.  
Susan Blackmore (2001) has noted that psi phenomena are frequently invoked in support of the contention that consciousness plays some fundamental role in the universe.  She argues that, in view of the fact that psi is often considered to operate primarily at a subconscious or unconscious level, the assertion that psi phenomena are evidence for a fundamental role for consciousness is unwarranted.
Machine Consciousness. Most people would grant consciousness to seemingly intelligent animals such as chimpanzees, elephants, whales and dogs, although there are still those who follow Descartes’ lead in denying consciousness to all animals other than human.  (Descartes thought that “lower” animals were mere machines, from whence springs the opinion expressed by some people today that animals can not suffer or feel pain, thus rationalizing the mistreatment of such animals.)  Most people, aside from the panpsychists, would draw the line between conscious and nonconscious beings somewhere “down” the “hierarchy” of living and nonliving things, perhaps before one gets to ameobae, petunias, or slabs of granite.  
What about humanly-manufactured machines that exhibit more complexity and activity than does, say, a slab of granite?  Do thermostats feel a twinge of pain when the thermometer passes the set point and the furnace is not yet turned on? The famous neurophysiologist W. Grey Walter constructed mechanical “tortoises,” which ambulated about his house randomly until they ran low on power, at which point they would proceed to the nearest electrical socket to recharge themselves. Were Walter’s tortoises conscious?  Did they feel “hunger” for electricity?  What about modern computers that can defeat any human at chess?
Many people argue that, if a machine or computer were able to duplicate human thought processes, there is no need to postulate the existence of an immaterial mind or soul to explain human thought, as human-manufactured computers are presumably not endowed with such ethereal entities as souls or minds.
Roger Penrose (1987b), David Layzer (1990) and John Searle (1990), have argued that, even if computers were to prove capable of simulating human behavior, this would not imply that computers possess awareness or have conscious experiences. Rather, they see the biochemical “wetware” of the human brain as having specific properties necessary for the production of consciousness that the hardware of a typical digital computer lacks.  On the other hand, their assertions that the particular properties of biological wetware are necessary for the generation of conscious experience are not in general supported by any convincing argument.  It would be desirable, therefore, to have a more or less objective test to determine whether a computer or robot is conscious.
Just such a test was proposed by the mathematician Alan Turing (1950, 1964) in the form of an imitation game (which has since become known as the Turing test).  If a human being communicating with a computer and with another human being through a teletype machine (or, these days, a computer monitor) cannot tell which is the computer and which is the human being, then the computer should be deemed conscious (in other words, if you are willing to ascribe consciousness to the human being on the basis of her behavior, you should extend the same courtesy to the computer).
Could a computer successfully pass the Turing test? Computers operate by following mathematical algorithms (fixed, mechanical procedures for solving a problem or producing output).  Roger Penrose (1987b, 1989, 1994) has argued that human thought does not rely exclusively on such algorithms. Penrose bases his contention that human thought must have a nonalgorithmic component in part on mathematician Kurt Gödel’s famous incompleteness theorem. In 1931, Gödel shocked the mathematical world by demonstrating that there exist statements within any reasonably powerful mathematical axiom system that are true but which can never be proved to be true within the axiom system itself. To oversimplify slightly, such a statement might read as follows: “This theorem is not provable.” Let us call this statement Theorem X. If Theorem X were provable, a contradiction would result, as Theorem X asserts its own unprovability. Therefore, if the mathematical axiom system is consistent, Theorem X could never be proven. Consequently, Theorem X is true, as it simply asserts its own unprovability. Computers, being driven by algorithms, are equivalent to mathematical axiom systems. Hence, a computer would be unable to perceive the truth of its own Theorem X, as it would only regard as true those statements that it could prove.  Humans, on the other hand, are readily able to perceive the truth of such statements as Theorem X.  Hence, Penrose argues, human thought is not algorithmic and therefore could not be simulated by an algorithmic computer. The chief difference between the computer and the human in this regard might be that the human can understand the meaning of the statements involved, whereas computers just blindly manipulate symbols according to prescribed rules without any idea of what those symbols might mean.
Penrose has further argued that, as human awareness must be noncomputational in nature and as current laws of physics are essentially computational systems, new principles of physics may be required to explain humans’ capacity to achieve direct insight into mathematical problems and to understand the meaning of language. 
Penrose (1994) observes that Kurt Gödel himself maintained that the mind was not identical to the physical brain, as Gödel felt that the physical brain would necessarily be a computationally-based system.  Gödel was thus a dualist.  As we shall see, Penrose has come to view consciousness as intimately connected to nonlocal quantum processes in the brain.  He sees such noncomputable quantum processes as being a prerequisite for consciousness.  Any system based entirely on simple computation must be nonconscious in Penrose’s view.
Paul Churchland (1995), perhaps the foremost defender of radical materialism in the modern era, has expressed agreement with Penrose’s position that human reasoning is nonalgorithmic.  Churchland does not, however, see such nonalgorithmic reasoning as emerging from arcane quantum mechanical processes, but rather from the continuous, analog nature of the human brain (as compared to Turing machines, which operate by entering one discrete state after another).
Philosopher John Searle (1987, 1990) has argued that even if a computer were to successfully simulate human behavior, this would not imply consciousness on the part of the computer. As an analogy, he considers the case of a person who does not speak Chinese who sits alone in a room with a book of rules instructing him how to respond to strings of Chinese characters. While a speaker of Chinese may think he is engaging in a dialogue with this person by swapping notes back and forth under the door to the room, the person inside the room does not in fact understand what the Chinese speaker is saying or what he himself is saying, as he does not know what the symbols mean. Similarly, Searle argues, computers are engaged in a purely syntactic manipulation of symbols and have no idea of what those symbols mean. 
Christian Kaernbach (2005) recently tested Searle’s Chinese room argument by having human subjects simulate addition and multiplication modulo 5 (i.e., “clock” arithmetic on a five-hour clock in which 3 + 4 = 2, for instance) by following a “look up” table similar to that provided to the subject in Searle’s Chinese room.  Kaernbach found that his subjects gained no insight into the meaning of their symbolic operation unless they were specifically informed of the connection to mathematical operations.  Kaernbach’s results would appear to substantiate Searle’s intuition.
In his later publications, Searle does concede that a robot might be said to have semantic and not just merely syntactical understanding of linguistic symbols if the robot were provided with sensing devices (such as TV cameras) and motor apparatus (such as robot arms). In such a case, the robot could develop a sensory “awareness” of the outside world and could gain an inkling of “insight” into the fact that words refer to objects and events in an outside world.
 It may be argued that, even if a computer could simulate human thought, humans quite possibly possess psi abilities that may be indicative of a spiritual or immaterial aspect to human beings.  Computers, being mere machines, would presumably be incapable of demonstrating such psi powers. Actually, Turing himself considered this objection in his original proposal of the imitation game. He suggested that computers might be able to manifest, or least simulate, psi powers if a random event generator (REG) were included in the computer’s design.  Such REGs, which are a common tool of the parapsychologist’s trade, are essentially electronic “coin flipping” devices, often based on quantum mechanical uncertainty.  For instance, “heads” might be defined to occur if a Geiger counter recorded the first decay of a strontium 90 atom in as occurring during an odd microsecond, and “tails” might be defined to occur if the first decay occurred during an even microsecond. Such quantum mechanical decay is based on the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and is (according to standard theories of physics) truly random.  Even a physicist with complete knowledge of the REG system (which must be less than complete in any event due to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle) could not predict when such a decay will occur.
Once the REG system is implanted in the computer, the computer might appear to have psi powers (at least if humans themselves have such powers).  For instance, in a telepathy experiment, the “sender” (e.g., person looking at an ESP card and attempting to transmit its identity to the computer) could subconsciously use his psychokinetic (PK) powers to influence the REG in such a way as to make it appear that the computer has ESP.  Various PK tasks posed to the computer might be performed inadvertently through the experimenter’s use of her own PK abilities (especially if the experimenter was rooting for the computer).  Thus, to all appearances, the computer would have psi powers. 
To pursue this line of thought even further, it would be interesting to speculate what would happen if a large number of quantum-mechanically based REGs were installed in the computer.  If minds are to be equated with the “hidden variables” that govern the outcome of quantum decisions, perhaps such a largely nondeterministic computer would be able to acquire a mind.  Of course, it would no longer be the sort of deterministic, algorithm-following sort of computer that is known as a Turing machine. Instead, it might be something approaching a silicon-based life form.
In the end, the real test of consciousness in automata such as robots and computers may be to wait to see if such machines spontaneously express curiosity and wonderment about their own inner experience, much as human philosophers of mind do. Presumably, a nonconscious computer would not develop a preoccupation with the machine equivalent of the mind-body problem.
Dualistic Philosophies
We are thus led to consider dualist positions, which grant independent reality to both mental and physical events. We will begin with parallelism.
Parallelism. Parallelism is a peculiar form of dualism in that it insists that the realms of mind and matter are totally separate and do not interact at all. One of the foremost advocates of this doctrine was the seventeenth century mathematician and philosopher Gottfried Willhelm Leibniz (1714/1965), who asserted that God had placed the physical and mental realms in “preestablished harmony” so that they are forever in correspondence with one another, much as two synchronized clocks continue to display the same time as one another. Parallelism seems to have one more realm than it needs.  After all, the reason that we postulate the existence of a physical world in the first place is to explain certain regularities in our sensory experience. If the physical world is not the cause of our sensations, there is really no reason to postulate its existence at all. Which brings up…
Interactionism. Interactionists, as their name implies, assume that the mental and physical realms do in fact interact with one another. Unlike epiphenomenalism, in interactionism the causal highway is a two-way street. Not only do events in the physical realm cause mental events, but mental events are capable of influencing physical events as well.  As we have mentioned, since the advent of the theory of quantum mechanics, the brain is no longer considered to be a completely deterministic system and therefore could be open to influence from a mental realm. (In this context, however, it should be noted that some die-hard materialists such as philosopher Daniel Dennett (1991) continue to reject dualism on the basis of arguments involving the outmoded concept of a deterministic brain system.)  In fact, the brain seems almost designed in such a way as to maximize its receptivity to such influence from a nonmaterial mind. Neurophysiologist John Eccles has called the brain just “the sort of a machine a ‘ghost’ could operate,” as its functioning is dependent on minute electrical potentials and the motions of neurotransmitter molecules and calcium ions (Eccles 1953, p. 285).  Several prominent physicists, including Niels Bohr (1958), Arthur Eddington (1935), Henry Margenau (1984), Euan Squires (1990) and Henry Stapp (1992), have explicitly proposed that the mind interacts with the brain by influencing the outcome of quantum processes within the brain.  
Roger Penrose (1987a) has suggested that the “oneness” or “global” quality of consciousness may be related to nonlocal quantum connections between neural processes in the brain, and he further notes that neurons, unlike the elements of deterministic computers, are subject to quantum mechanical influences.  In the more recent versions of Penrose’s theory, he proposes that water molecules in the microtubules composing the cytoskeletons of widely separated neurons could exist in a quantum-mechanically coherent state. As the configuration of such cytoskeletons could influence the synaptic connections between neurons, this would provide a nonlocal means of unifying neural activity over wide regions of the brain. In fact, Penrose equates the operation of free will with quantum mechanical decisions influencing the configuration of such microtubules.  It should, however, be noted that Penrose objects to the dualistic view that an immaterial mind external to the physical brain system can influence the outcomes of quantum mechanical processes in the brain.  Rather than being caused by conscious awareness, Penrose proposes that quantum mechanical state vector reduction occurs when the energy difference between the alternative physical outcomes becomes sufficiently great (Penrose, 1994).  Penrose’s theory is based in part on Stuart Hameroff’s proposal that the cytoskeletal microtubules within neurons may be centrally involved in the computational activity of the brain. Hameroff, incidentally, concurs with Penrose’s view that conscious experience may involve nonlocal quantum connections between microtubules in widely separated neurons.  Hameroff thinks that such connections may help to bind diverse neural activity into unified perceptions and experiences and to provide a unified sense of the self. He also sees such connections as providing the indeterminism necessary for the operation of “free will” (Hameroff, 1994).   
In particular, Penrose has contended that water molecules in widely separated microtubules could exist in a quantum-mechanically coherent state and that nonlocally correlated changes in cytoskeleton configurations could alter synaptic connections between neurons. He sees such conformational changes as being intimately associated with the experience of “free will” (Penrose, 1994).  However, Rick Grush and Patricia Churchland (1995) have argued that microtubules are not in close enough proximity to the synaptic complex to influence synaptic transmission.  They also note that the gout drug colchicine depolymerizes microtubules, disrupting any quantum mechanical coherence that might be present, but is not associated with any loss of consciousness.   In reply to Grush and Churchland, Penrose and Hameroff (1995) counter that very little colchicine enters the brain and that most brain microtubules are hardened and do not undergo cycles of polymerization and depolymerization. They also note that the drug does in fact cause impairments in learning and memory.
  David Hodgson (1991) has seconded Penrose’s assertion that consciousness is intimately dependent on nonlocal connections between spatially separated brain events.  In his view, such connections help forge a united perception of an object from its separate features.  He conjectures that nature had to provide such nonlocal connections in order for consciousness to exist.  He further contends that only indeterministic systems are associated with consciousness, as conscious minds would be of no use to a mechanistic system.  Physicist A. J. Leggett  (1987a) has even suggested that new quantum principles may be needed to describe the behavior of complex systems such as brains.  Penrose (1994) agrees with this position of Leggett and proposes that new laws of physics will be required to explain noncomputational brain activity.
There has even been an attempt to subject the theory that nonlocal quantum processes undergird conscious thought to an experimental test.  Nunn, Clarke, and Blott (1994) found that when a record was made of the electrical activity of one of the brain’s hemispheres, performance on psychological tasks involving that hemisphere was enhanced.  More specifically, they found that subjects’ performance in a button-pushing task was more accurate if EEG recordings were made of the motor areas of the brain involved in the task than if recordings of other areas of the brain were made.  Presumably, the making of an EEG recording assisted in collapsing quantum mechanical state vectors, resulting in more efficient cognitive performance.  
There have been many who have had difficulty conceptualizing how such different entities as mind (which Descartes and many subsequent philosophers regarded as immaterial and lacking any spatial extension) could interact with matter.  For instance, in regard to Descartes’ notion that the mind interacted with the human brain through the deflection of the animal spirits as they passed through the pineal gland, the philosopher Thomas Metzinger says: 
Something without any spatial properties cannot causally interact with something possessing spatial properties at a specific location.  If Descartes had taken his own premises seriously, he could never have come up with this solution, which is so obviously false.  If the mind truly is an entity not present in physical space, it would be absurd to look for a locus of interaction in the human brain.  (Metzinger, 2003, p. 381.  Emphasis in original.) 
  As each of us seems to be somehow “stuck” in a human brain, however temporarily, it would in fact seem that the self, construed as a field of consciousness, does have some spatial properties, if only the property that it is, at least temporarily, somehow stuck to (or under the panpsychistic hypothesis, part of) a human brain occupying a particular region in space.
From this it does not follow that the self in its entirety is confined to a spatial location in the human brain or circumscribed region of space.  As we shall see in the next chapter, even the elementary particles of matter such as electrons and protons typically do not have any particular spacetime location until they are forced to adopt one through an act of observation.  Even physical matter lacks the material properties ascribed to it by Metzinger.
The British psychologist and philosopher John Beloff (1998) notes that under the general theory of relativity, matter influences and is influenced by spacetime, despite the fact that material particles and spacetime continua are radically different types of entities.  If their different natures do not prevent matter and spacetime from mutually influencing each other, argues Beloff, then there is not reason why mind and matter could not also interact despite their seemingly different natures.  Similarity in properties may not be a necessary condition for causal interaction.
Another conceptual objection to interactionism is that mind-brain interaction would involve violations of the laws of physics.  Many writers, including Mohrhoff (1999), Wilson (1999), Levin (2000), Jaswal (2005) and Clark (2005a), have argued that any action of a nonphysical mind on the brain would entail the violation of physical laws, such as the conservation of energy and momentum and the requirement that the outcomes of quantum processes be randomly determined.
Levin (2000) argues that dualist interaction would involve a violation of the law of the conservation of energy.  However, the noted philosopher Karl Popper has suggested that the mind may have its own source of (presumably physical) energy.  Under this view, the mind would be a sort of quasiphysical object that might be capable of greater influence on the brain than that allowed by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics. Popper even went so far as to assert that the law of energy is only “statistically valid” (Popper & Eccles, 1977, p.541).  Without going to this extreme, it could be argued that mind is capable of exerting some force on some of the material particles in the brain.  Also, we are a long way from having measured with precision every minute energy transaction in human brains. In the process of doing so, it is conceivable that some unexpected energy transaction may be observed. If science should progress to the point where the action of spheres of consciousness on energy transactions within the brain can somehow be mathematically (or otherwise) described, this might be a victory for the contention that immaterial minds can exert physical force.  If such spheres of consciousness are identified with known material particles and system, the physicalists could claim victory.  If not, the dualists could so declare.  
If spheres of consciousness could exert some sort of physical force, it is likely that they would be declared as a new form of physical matter or energy, resulting in a victory for the physicalists.  If the present day physicalists opine that all physical particles have already been discovered, this may only be evidence for the psychological tendency toward premature closure, in that they fervently wish to believe that they already possess virtually complete understanding of the universe.  But such a declaration could only be the worst form of arrogance in view of the fact, already noted, that physicists have only recently discovered the existence of dark energy, which is now believed to comprise three-quarters of the matter-energy in the universe.
Many writers (e.g., Beck, 1994; Bohr, 1958; Eddington, 1935; Hameroff, 1994; Hodgson, 1991, 2005a; Leggett, 1987a, 1987b; Margenau, 1984; Penrose, 1994; Squires, 1990; Stapp, 1992, 1996; Walker, 2000) have noted that the classical deterministic theory of Newtonian physics has been replaced with the indeterminism of quantum mechanics, in which many possible futures may arise from a given present state of the universe, and have suggested that the conscious mind or “free will” may act on the brain by selecting a particular quantum state (i.e. forcing the quantum mechanical state vector to “collapse” to a desired outcome).  In fact, Eccles (1953, p. 285) noted that the brain is just “the sort of machine a ‘ghost’ could operate,” as its functioning is dependent on minute electrical potentials and the motions of neurotransmitters and calcium ions.  Thus, in Eccles’ view, at least as expressed in his later writings (e.g., Eccles, 1989), changes in macroscopic brain activity may be brought about without violating the limits of indeterminacy allowed under the theory of quantum mechanics.
A similar view has been expressed more recently by physicist Henry Stapp (2005b), who asserts that quantum mechanical laws must be used to describe the process of exocytosis (the emission of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft), citing empirical research in support of this assertion (Schwartz, Stapp & Beauregard, 2005).  In particular, Stapp notes that the “quantum Zeno effect” (maintaining a quantum state through repeated observation) provides a means whereby conscious minds could act on the physical brain, namely by holding the brain in a particular state.  He cites William James’ observation that the role of conscious attention is to preserve brain states in support of this view.  He also notes that Pashler (1998) has observed that consciousness may act as an information-processing bottleneck in this regard.   
Contrary views have been expressed by Jaswal (2005) and Clark (2005a), among others, who argue that any such influence on quantum mechanical processes would lead to a violation of the statistical predictions of quantum mechanics and the principle that the outcome of quantum mechanical processes are randomly determined.  Such influence would therefore constitute a violation of the laws of physics.   
First of all, it should be noted, as many observers have argued, that description of the universe afforded by the laws of quantum mechanics is incomplete.  Also, no one has provided, or likely ever will provide, a complete description of the quantum state of any brain at any time.  We may discover new entities or processes that may be identified with the so-called “hidden variables” that determine the outcomes of quantum processes.  Also, quantum mechanical outcomes may indeed be random in simple physical systems, but may be less random in certain complex systems, such as human brains, in which the observing consciousnesses may have a more vested interest.  It may also be that such consciousnesses enjoy a closer physical proximity to physical brains, on the view that quasi-physical spheres of consciousness may be, at least, temporarily, somehow “stuck” in physical brains.  
Thus, it might turn out that the outcomes of quantum processes inside complex systems such as brains are not randomly determined but are governed by fields of consciousness, whereas those in simpler systems are not so governed.  Also, many parapsychological researchers, going back to Schmidt (1969, 1970), have produced evidence that conscious minds may be capable of determining, or at least biasing, the outcomes of quantum processes, as will be discussed in more detail in subsequent chapters.  
Having discussed the general framework, we will now consider specific versions of dualistic interaction that have been proposed in recent times.  Thus discussion will be an introductory one, and a more detailed discussion of some of the philosophical and scientific issues raised by modern models of dualistic interaction will be postponed until Chapters 2, 5 and 7.
Eccles’ theory of mind-brain interaction.  There are few adherents to the doctrine of dualistic interaction among working scientists today.  John Eccles was perhaps the most prominent example of such a scientist in the second half of the twentieth century.  Eccles was a renowned neurophysiologist, who in 1963 shared the Nobel prize in medicine and physiology with his coworkers A. L. Hodgkin and A. F. Huxley.  The prize was awarded for their studies of the axons of the giant squid, establishing the membrane theory of nerve conduction and demonstrating the exchange of sodium and potassium ions across the membrane (which has come to be recognized as the basic mechanism of nerve impulses).
Eccles progressively elaborated his dualistic model in a series of publications spanning several decades (e.g., Eccles, 1953, 1970, 1977, 1979, 1980, 1983, 1987, 1989; Eccles & Robinson, 1984; Popper & Eccles, 1977).  Eccles felt that it is necessary to postulate the existence of a mind separate from the brain in order to explain the integration of mental activity.  In particular, Eccles felt that the integrated perception of objects and visually presented scenes cannot be explained in terms of known neurological processes, in view of the fact that the nervous impulses related to visual experiences appear to be fragmented and sent to divergent areas of the brain. For instance, Christof Koch and Francis Crick count from 30 to 40 different cortical areas specializing in different aspects of visual processing (Koch & Crick, 1991). Similarly, Wilson, Scalaidhe and Goldman-Rakic (1993) have described the separation of the neurons dealing with the spatial location and identity (color and shape) of an object in the prefrontal cortex of the brain of a monkey.  Hodgson (2005b) notes that red circles are experienced as a whole (or “gestalt”) despite the fact that the neurons “reporting” “red” and “circle” are located in different areas of the brain.
In view of the fact that the perception of any single object involves the firing of neurons in widely dispersed areas of the brain, it is difficult to understand how this neural activity can possibly result in a unified perception of an object.  This conundrum is generally termed the “binding problem” (Koch & Crick, 1991). In Hodgson’s view, the experience of gestalts such as his example of the red circle indicates that consciousness may be nonlocal in the quantum mechanical sense (Hodgson, 2005b).  The relationship between quantum nonlocality and consciousness will be revisited several times in the chapters to follow.
 Stacia Friedman-Hill, Lynn Robertson and Anne Triesman (1995) report an instance in which a breakdown of this perceptual unity was apparent in a patient who miscombined colors and shapes from different objects and who was unable to judge the locations of objects. This patient had bilateral lesions in the parietal-occipital areas of the brain, suggesting that these brain regions may be centrally involved in generating unified perceptions of experience.  
Francis Crick (1994) ascribed the unity of perception to rhythmic oscillations in the brain resulting in the synchronous firing of large populations of neurons.  
Two other neurophysiologists, Gerald Edelman and Giulio Jononi (1995), have contended that the binding of perceptions and the unity of experience is achieved thorough reentrant signaling pathways in the brain.
Eccles, on the other hand, saw the integration of neural activity as the raison d’être of an immaterial mind, and he suggested that the evolution of consciousness may have paralleled the emergence of the visual processing mechanism.  He endorsed William James’ conjecture that brains may have had to acquire conscious minds because they had grown too complex to control themselves.
Eccles proposed that another role of consciousness is to assist in the solving of nonroutine problems (as opposed to the execution of overlearned and routine skills such as tying one’s shoes). Eccles’ view of the role of consciousness is similar to that of many cognitive psychologists in this regard.
Eccles contended that the mind interacts with only certain groups (or “modules”) of neurons, which he called “open neurons.”  He used the term “liaison brain” to refer to the regions of the brain containing these open modules, and he asserted that this liaison brain lies in the cerebral cortex rather than in the deeper areas of the middle brain. In support of this site, he cited a study by Bard (1968) indicating that cats who have had their cerebral cortex removed behave as if they were mindless automata.
In his earlier writings, Eccles maintained that the liaison brain was generally located in the left cerebral hemisphere, due to the fact that language ability is usually located in that hemisphere and the fact that split-brain patients typically report (from the left hemisphere where their language skills are located) that they have experienced no discontinuity in their sense of self following their commisurotomy (an operation that involves severing the corpus callosum, a bundle of nerve fibers that connect the two hemispheres of the brain and provide the primary means for communication between them).
Some evidence in favor of Eccles’ theory that the left brain is the site of consciousness was provided by a study by Efron (1963b) indicating that flashes presented to the left and right visual fields were judged to be simultaneous only when the flash on the left occurred several thousandths of a second before the one on the right, suggesting that the judgment of simultaneity was made on the basis of the simultaneous arrival of the neural messages at a site in the left hemisphere. (Strangely enough, information about the right visual field is sent directly to the left hemisphere and information about the left visual field to the right.)
Another piece of evidence in favor of locating the liaison brain in the left hemisphere is the fact that migraine attacks and brain injuries are more often associated with a loss of consciousness when they occur in the left hemisphere than when they occur in the right (Miller, 1990).
In his earlier writings, Eccles tended to see linguistic ability as a prerequisite for self-consciousness, and he consequently denied self-consciousness to most nonhuman animals and even to the right hemisphere of the human brain following commisurotomy.  He later recanted this position, citing Gallup’s (1977) research demonstrating self-recognition by chimpanzees when confronted by their images in a mirror (they cleaned spots off their faces) and research by Sperry, Zaidel and Zaidel (1979) demonstrating the ability of the right hemisphere in split-brain patients to recognize pictures of themselves (the patients, not the hemispheres!).  Eccles maintained that consciousness is restricted to birds and mammals, the brains of lower animals such as bees and frogs being too small to support consciousness in his view. (Interestingly, Eccles has assigned consciousness to precisely those animals that sleep. Could there be some significance to this?)
In Eccles’ earlier writings, he expressed doubt that influences at the quantum level would be sufficient to explain the influence of the mind on the brain, as he felt that quantum events would be too random to account for the “precisely causal” events in the mind-brain interaction. In his later writings, he changed his mind, observing in particular that the exocytosis of synaptic vesicles (a primary mechanism in the transmission of nervous impulses from one neuron to another) involves energies within the range of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics (and thus would allow the mind to influence the brain by determining the outcomes of quantum decisions).  Although Eccles cagily avoided referring to parapsychology in most of his writings, as least on one occasion (Eccles, 1977), he used the word “psychokinesis” to describe the mind’s action on the brain.
The prominent philosopher of science Karl Popper, with whom Eccles wrote his most encyclopedic volume, The Mind and Its Brain, also endorsed a quantum-mechanically based theory of mind-brain interaction; however, at one point in the book Popper suggested that the mind may have its own source of (presumably physical) energy (Popper & Eccles, 1977).  Under this view, the mind would be a sort of quasi-physical object that might be capable of greater influence on the brain than that allowed by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics. Thus, the conscious mind proposed by Popper is a powerful one indeed.
Penfield’s theory of mind-brain interaction. Another prominent neurophysiologist to propose a dualistic model of mind-brain interaction in the second half of the twentieth century was Wilder Penfield. The most complete exposition of his model was given in his posthumously published book The Mystery of the Mind (Penfield, 1975).  Unlike Eccles, Penfield did not locate the site of mind-brain interaction in the cerebral cortex, but rather in the evolutionarily older region of the higher brain stem (diencephalon).  (Such a site would make evolutionary sense if immaterial minds are to be attributed to more “primitive” organisms that lack a neocortex.)  As one piece of evidence in favor of this localization, Penfield cited the fact that injury to this site typically removes consciousness and results in a coma.  Interestingly, Penfield did not believe that the site of mind-brain interaction lies in the reticular activating system of the brain stem, despite the fact that injury to this area also produces unconsciousness. This was due in large part to the fact that Penfield assigned a central role to the diencephalon in the integration of brain activity.  In particular, he cited the vast number of two-way connections between the diencephalon and the cerebral cortex as evidence for such a central role. 
The neurophysiologist Robert Thompson agreed with Penfield that the higher brain stem may be centrally involved in integrating behavior.  In support of this assertion, Thompson cited research indicating that injuries to this region produce deficits in a wide range of learning and problem-solving tasks as well as evidence indicating that memories may be stored in this region (Thompson, 1993). 
The physicist Nick Herbert (1993) locates the site of consciousness a bit further down, in the reticular formation of the brain stem.  Herbert sees this area as having a central role in the integration of sensory information and the regulation of behavior.  He sees the cortex as a peripheral device that is not associated with consciousness.
John Eccles (in Popper & Eccles, 1977) explicitly took issue with Penfield’s proposed site of mind-brain interaction, arguing that injury to the brain stem merely removes the background excitation of the cerebral cortex that is necessary for consciousness to occur.   As evidence against Eccles’ localization of the site of mind-brain interaction in the cerebral cortex, Penfield cited the fact that large portions of the cerebral cortex can be removed without loss of consciousness.
As further evidence in support of his proposed site of interaction, Penfield cited the fact that epileptic seizures in the higher brain stem cause a person to behave as a mindless automaton, carrying out preprogrammed motor acts without a later memory of them. Penfield saw conscious attention as a prerequisite to the storing of memories.  In this, he agreed with Eccles, who cited an experiment by Held and Hein demonstrating that active exploration of the environment is associated with learning in kittens, whereas passive exploration (being carried around a room) is not (Eccles, 1979, discussing the experiment reported by Held & Hein, 1963).  However, in cases of multiple personality, secondary personalities seem to be capable of storing memories when the primary personality is distracted or unconscious (although such memories are not generally accessible to the primary personality).
As evidence that the conscious mind lies outside of the brain mechanism, Penfield cites the fact that movements or other activity produced by electrical stimulation of the brain are experienced as ego-alien and involuntary. For example, if Penfield applied an electrical stimulus to a patient’s brain causing her to raise her arm, she typically experienced the raising of the arm to occur independently of her will. Electrical stimulation of the brain never resulted in a sense of volition. (Of course, a materialist could object that this merely proves that the brain can discriminate arm movements initiated by it in an unmolested state from those caused by the application of an outside electrical impulse.) Penfield specifically declined to use the word “immaterial” to describe the mind, perhaps because he viewed such a term as implying a total separation between mind and matter.
Other views on mind-brain interaction. Many other theorists have forwarded their own hypotheses regarding the nature and location of mind-brain interaction. The number of sites proposed is legion, and at times it seems that no area of the brain will prove to be exempt from being designated as the site of the soul.  
V. S. Ramachandran (1980) sees the frontal lobes as the likeliest candidate for the site of mind-brain interaction, partially due to the fact that persons with frontal lobe lesions frequently report a loss of coherence and continuity in their sense of self. 
Joseph LeDoux (1985) equates consciousness with language use and thus associates it with the linguistic apparatus of the brain. He therefore denies consciousness to the right hemisphere in split-brain patients unless it possesses a linguistic capacity, in which case LeDoux would ascribe a dual consciousness to the patient. 
John O’Keefe (1985) sees consciousness as primarily concerned with the construction of mental representations of the world. He would therefore locate consciousness in the septohippocampal region of the brain, insofar as the neurophysiological evidence suggests that “cognitive maps” may be located in this area (certain neurons in a rat’s hippocampus may fire when the rat is in a particular location). O’Keefe also notes that conscious attention is necessary for the storage of episodes and narratives in memory, and certainly the hippocampus must be intact in order that such memories be stored.  Patients with damage to the hippocampal region are generally unable to form new episodic memories. Such a patient may for instance believe he is still a soldier in Korea, having formed no memories of events occurring in the years since he received his head injury.
O’Keefe further notes that consciousness is especially involved in dealing with novel events. The conscious mind, he asserts, selects actions to be carried out, but is not involved in the details of these action programs (such as the specific steps involved in tying a shoe). These action programs instead tend to be automatic and occur outside of awareness. He does note that consciousness is involved in the initial learning of such programs. Conscious attention is also activated when the result of a motor action is unexpected and deviates from the fixed action plan. He observes that certain neurons in the hippocampal area tend to fire when an organism is confronted with a novel situation, which he takes as further support for the hippocampus as the site of consciousness.
Like O’Keefe, David Oakley (1985a, 1985b). asserts that the conscious mind is intimately involved with the creation of cognitive representations of the world. He notes that the hippocampus and neocortex must be intact for such representations to emerge, as opposed to simple conditioned responses.   In an article written with Lesley Eames, Oakley suggests that two or more domains of consciousness may coexist within a single person (Oakely & Eames, 1985). Oakley and Eames note, for instance, that associative learning occurred separately for each of the alternate personalities in the “Jonah” case of multiple personality (Ludwig, Brandsma, Wilbur, Bendfeldt & Jameson,1972), whereas Pavlovian conditioning, which they view as noncortical and automatic, was shared among the different personalities.  Oakely and Eames also attribute a dual consciousness to split brain patients, although they see “self-awareness” as usually being restricted to the left hemisphere.
Benjamin Libet (1989, 1991a) views the supplementary motor area (SMA) of the cerebral cortex as being one of the primary areas that is involved in voluntary acts.  In this he agrees with Eccles, who at one point went so far as to say that “there is strong support for hypothesis that the SMA is the sole recipient area of the brain for mental intentions that lead to voluntary movements” (Eccles, 1983, p. 45).  Libet notes that patients with damaged supplementary motor areas are often incapable of spontaneous voluntary movement; while they may listlessly respond to suggestions from others, they seldom initiate movements on their own. In this sense their will is curtailed. Libet’s view is underscored by Goldberg’s observation that lesions of the supplementary motor area lead to repetitive hand movements, such as buttoning and unbuttoning a shirt, that are experienced as ego-alien and occurring independently of the subject’s will (Goldberg, 1985).  Libet further observes that blood flows into the supplementary motor area when movements are merely being contemplated.
Libet’s own experiments indicate that subjects’ decisions to initiate motor movements (flexing the hand) typically do not occur until 350 milliseconds after a readiness potential has begun to build in the brain, indicating that the brain itself has already been preparing for movement at the time of the subject’s experienced decision.  Libet notes, however, that mind-brain interaction must be a two-way street, and he found that subjects could change their mind about flexing their hands during the final 150 milliseconds preceding the actual physical act.  He also found that this veto decision seemed to coincide in time with a drop in the voltage of the readiness potential.  Libet infers from this that the conscious mind has the ability to block an already initiated movement or to let it occur.  In this view, the brain is seen as generating courses of action, while the mind or a “free will” decides on the options. He sees the inhibition of action as one of the central roles of a conscious mind.  
Levy (2005) has interpreted Libet’s results in a somewhat different manner.  Levy notes that Libet’s subjects may have delegated the task of deciding when to flex their hand to processes occurring in the “unconscious” regions of their minds.  Levy also notes that it is reasonable to doubt whether Libet is correct in identifying the unconscious brain activity with the intention to or decision to act rather than with the generation of an urge or desire to act.
To explicate the process of mind-brain interaction, Libet (1994) postulates the existence of a “conscious mind field” (CMF), which he sees as being produced by brain activity. The CMF is not capable of being detected by physical measuring devices, nor is it reducible to neural processes; nevertheless, Libet proposes that the CMF is capable of exerting a causal influence on brain processes and that it provides the means whereby diverse neural activity can give rise to unified perceptions and experiences. Libet contends that his view of the CMF is compatible with a variety of different philosophical positions on the mind-body problem.  Libet’s views are discussed in more detail in Chapter 7.
The staunch defender of materialism Paul Churchland (1995) has proposed the intralaminar nucleus of the thalamus as the brain site responsible for producing a “unified consciousness.” (Yes, even that ardent proponent of reductionist materialism Paul Churchland has been forced on occasion to use the word “consciousness” in a nonpejorative sense.)  Churchland bases his claim on the fact that this brain site possesses two-way projections to diverse areas of the brain as well as the fact that the various senses are represented polymodally in this area. He notes that his colleague Antonio Damasio (1994) has nominated the right parietal lobe of the brain for a similar role, as this area must be intact in order for a continuous sense of the self to exist.   
Jean Burns (1993) has suggested that the synchronous firing of large assemblies of neurons underlies conscious experience and forms the interface for mind-brain interaction. Burns’ theory is based on brain wave records and recordings from single neurons showing that such synchronous firings are involved in acts of conscious perception.  Burns’ view in this regard is very similar to that of Koch and Crick, discussed above.
Indeed, it would almost seem that no region of the brain has been omitted from the list of brain regions that form the primary center of consciousness according to one researcher or another.  In addition to the candidates listed above we have the thalamus (Cotterill, 1995), nonrandom, coherent deviations of the brain’s electromagnetic field from its resting state (John, 2003), and, last but not least, quantum-mechanically entangled water in the microtubules composing the cytoskeletons of neurons (Penrose, 1994; Hameroff, 1994).  Each of these authors presents a cogent argument in favor of their candidate for the area of the brain (or brain process) that is the center of consciousness (or of the interaction between consciousness and mind).
With this many candidates for the primary center of consciousness (or of interaction between the conscious mind and brain), it may begin to seem that no center is primary, that many different brain centers and processes may be associated with their own conscious activity, and that these centers of consciousness may not be mutually accessible to one another, at least in a direct sense.  This possibility will be discussed in much further detail in Chapters 5 and 7.
Mysterianism
Last, but by far not least, there is strangely appealing doctrine of “mysterianism,” whose most notable proponent is Colin McGinn (1999).  McGinn contends that the biological wetware of our brains has evolved to enable us to reason about and understand the physical world rather than to solve such esoteric problems as the nature of consciousness and the fate of the soul.  Our globs of 1011  pulsating amoeba-like neurons are more likely designed to discover how to better secure a stone axe head to a stick to beat upon our neighbor’s brain than to enable us to understand the realms to which our neighbor’s consciousness has fled after we have completed our handiwork.
 In McGinn’s view, the role of consciousness and the nature of the soul will forever remain beyond our cognitive grasp as our primate brains have evolved to seek fruit and elude tigers and deal with other concrete concerns in the physical world.  McGinn opines that the nature of consciousness and its relation to the physical world must remain outside of the grasp of consciousness, at least of those consciousnesses inhabiting our primitive primate brains, which are unequal to the task of understanding their true nature.  Perhaps McGinn is right.  Perhaps that is why consciousness is often referred to as the “hard problem” of philosophy.  But, unlike our ape brethren, we have been to the moon and plumbed the creation of the universe down to the first femtosecond.  It is premature to give up trying to understand the nature of our conscious mind.  As we shall see, such understanding may require us to relinquish core beliefs about the nature of our selves and the quasi-permanence of our association with any particular body.
 Once we have shed our present body and the “self-cocoons” we have wrapped around us to keep us firmly fixed to our present personalities, who knows what wonders may await us?

Mind-Matter Connection: How Our Thoughts Affect and Manifest Reality
Updated: Feb 23, 2022
The average person has thousands of thoughts a day, somewhere between 6000 to 70,000… That’s a lot of thoughts! Most of us are not very careful with our thoughts, but what if our thoughts actually turned out to be very powerful? What if our thoughts could affect our physical world? Actually…they do!

I remember back in high school science, I learned a little bit about quantum physics, and I found it super interesting. Many years later, I read Dr. Joe Dispenza's books Breaking the Habit of Being Yourself and Becoming Supernatural. Both of these books use quantum physics to explain how our mind can influence and even manifest physical matter!


When we understand that our thoughts can change our reality, we can make good use of those 6000 to 70,000 thoughts per day to manifest better futures, such as good health, harmonious relationships, career success, a clean environment, and a peaceful world.

This article will look how our thoughts and emotions affect physical matter from a quantum physics perspective, explain how to manifest, and give some real life applications.

Conclusion 


Part 1: Quantum Physics Explains How Thoughts Affect Matter
How could our non-physical thoughts affect physical matter? Although this idea seems surprising to those of us who grew in the modern western world, this is not surprising at all to people who grew up in the East. Ancient Eastern religions, such as Buddhism, Hinduism, and Daoism all teach that the physical world is manifested from the mind. And now, quantum physics has a scientific explanation. 
 We probably all know from high school science that all things are made of atoms, and atoms are made of subatomic particles like protons, neutrons, and electrons. If you keep going smaller and smaller, eventually, there is no more matter, but instead just wave energy. In other words, matter arises from electromagnetic wave energy.

We now know that an atom is 99.999999999999% empty space, and that empty space is actually wave energy. That means our five senses can only detect 0.0000000000001% of reality. Our five senses cannot detect most waves, such as radio waves, microwaves, UV rays, and X-rays, but we know such waves exist. All matter arises from waves, and waves are just energy. So where does this energy come from? 
 German physicist Max Planck said, 
“I can tell you as a result of my research about atoms this much: There is no matter as such. All matter originates and exists only by virtue of a force which brings the particle of an atom to vibration and holds this most minute solar system of the atom together. We must assume behind this force the existence of a conscious and intelligent mind. This mind is the matrix of all matter."
 Quantum physicists call this "conscious and intelligent mind" the Quantum Field. Buddhism calls it "our true nature". Daoism calls it "The Dao". Western religions call it "God". For our purposes, we will continue with the quantum physics view.

All of our consciousness is connected to the Quantum Field, and all physical matter in the universe arises from this non-physical Quantum Field. The Quantum Field is in all space and all time, but we cannot perceive it with our 5 senses because it is not physical.
 To give an analogy, imagine you are looking at an ocean from above. The top of the ocean has waves and movement; that is like our physical world, always changing. The bottom of the ocean is still, invisible, and has infinite potential to make infinite waves at the top. The bottom of the ocean is like the Quantum Field.

The Observer Effect
Since our mind is linked to the Quantum Field, we can tap into that infinite field of possibilities to manifest a specific possibility. This is shown through The Observer Effect. 

For example, we know an atom has electrons. In the old Newtonian model of an atom, electrons orbit an atom’s nucleus in a set path, similar to how planets orbit the sun. But now, we know that electrons do not orbit in a set path, they actually exist in an invisible cloud of energy around the nucleus.

The Observer Effect shows that when an observer focuses attention on any one location of that energy cloud, the electron will appear there. If there is no observer, then the electron returns to being non-physical energy spread across the whole energy cloud. The conclusion is that our focused thought causes wave energy to condense there and become matter.

An electron is extremely small and has almost no mass, so it does not require a strong thought to manifest. But the Observer Effects proves a link between thought and matter. If we want to manifest bigger and denser things than an electron, that would take much more concentrated thought and energy.

The Law of Attraction
In Becoming Supernatural, Dr. Dispenza explains that our thoughts are electric, our emotions are magnetic, and together they make an electromagnetic field around our body. Our electromagnetic field is always communicating with the Quantum Field.

The Law of Attraction explains that if we change our electromagnetic field (by changing our thoughts and emotions), then that will attract a new reality from the Quantum Field. The thought must match the feeling, and then we have to hold that state of being long enough for the manifestation to occur. 

Part 2: Manifestation Using Visualization
Once we understand The Observer Effect and The Law of Attraction, we are ready explain the manifestation process in four steps.

Four Steps to Manifestation Using Visualization
Be very specific on what you want to manifest 
Feel right now what you would feel if you already obtained that manifestation (joy, gratitude, love)
Maintain that state of elevated emotions 
Wait for the surprise


The challenge is feeling and maintaining elevated emotions.
For step 2, we need to feel elevated emotions like joy, gratitude, and love BEFORE our manifestation actually happens. Like attracts like. Your elevated emotions will attract that wonderful event to you. If you try to manifest with lower emotions like stress, unhappiness, and lack, then you will manifest more suffering. 

Albert Einstein said,
“Everything is energy and that’s all there is to it. Match the frequency of the reality you want and you cannot help but get into that reality. It can be no other way. This is not philosophy, this is physics.”

How do you know if your manifestation is working? 
First of all, you should be feel great, as if you already got what you imagined. Second, that manifestation will come to us in a way we do not expect. If you make a plan and follow your plan and achieve your results, then you obtained it by working in the physical world; that is not manifestation. Since the Quantum Field has infinite potential, it will give you your manifestation in a way that you cannot predict, and that’s how you know it came through manifestation. 

Manifestation Example: Dream Job
In Becoming Supernatural, Dr. Dispenza explains how he guided his son to manifest his dream job. 
 Step 1: Think Clearly
Dr. Dispenza taught his son to write down all the specific details about that dream job, such as the working hours, the industry, the salary, and so on. This is the thought part (the electric part).
 Step 2: Feel Elevated
Then he told his son: Imagine how you would feel if you had that job. You would probably feel elevated emotions like gratitude, joy, wonder, and love. This is the feeling part (the magnetic part). 

In his journal, his son wrote "J" to signify dream job. On the left, he wrote down his thoughts on the details of the job. On the left, he wrote the elevated emotions he would feel.
Source: Becoming Supernatural by Dr. Joe Dispenza

Then the son visualized and meditated on those details and feelings every day. Each meditation session, He did not get up until it felt real, as if he already has that job right now.
 Step 3: Maintain Elevated
Dr. Dispenza warned his son: Throughout your day, you also need to hold that elevated emotional state so that your message to the Quantum Field does not change or break. If you return to lower emotions, the manifestation will stop and you will attract your old reality again.
 Step 4: Get Surprised
His son followed his father's instructions. Months later, the son “just happened” to bump into his idol surfer, and they “just happened” to have a great conversation, and his idol “just happened” to be looking for someone to hire, and he “just happened” to be a great fit. It was completely unpredictable. Dr. Dispenza lists lots of manifestation examples like this in his books.

Part 3: Manifestation Using Daily Self-Improvement
While the manifestation theory is fairly simple to understand, it is actually very difficult to do in real life. It is easy for people to think about what they want. The hard part is to feel and maintain the elevated emotions like joy, gratitude, and love. When life throws problems at us, it is hard for us to keep up elevated emotions and not fall into lower emotions.

Dr. Dispenza's method is to do visualization meditation every day to cultivate concentration and elevated emotions. I have tried it but after the meditation, I go back to my old habits of stress and worry. To be honest, even during the meditation, my mind is full of wandering thoughts, and I am unable to feel intense elevated emotions. Therefore, my emotional state is still attracting my current reality.
 Cultivate a Virtuous Heart and Cut Vices
Since ancient spiritual practices also know about how thoughts manifest reality, I looked to Daoism and Buddhist for other methods. They both emphasized the importance of cultivating a virtuous heart and eliminating vices in order to attract a better future.
 In The Treatise on Cause and Effect, the Daoist sage Lao Tzu said,
"Misfortune and fortune do not come through gates, they are created by ourselves…Fortunate people speak virtue, observe virtue, and do virtue. If each day you persevere in these three virtues, after three years, the Heavens will surely descend fortune upon you. Misfortunate people speak evil, observe evil, and do evil. If each day you persevere in these three evils, after three years, the Heavens will surely descend calamity upon you."
 Speaking virtue, observing virtue, and doing virtue is something anyone can do. Cultivating virtues will lead to more elevated emotions, while vices will lead to more low emotions.
If we can persevere for three years to cultivate virtues and eliminate vices, then our thoughts and heart will surely become elevated and attract a better reality. Moreover, we can even set a manifestation that we want and then cultivate virtues to obtain that specific goal! 

Manifestation Example: Wealth, Prestige, and Children
Liao Fan is a great role model of this daily self-improvement method. In his book, Liao Fan's Four Lessons, he explains how he spent many years cultivating virtuous deeds and thoughts. He wanted to obtain a high government job, which equates to wealth and prestige. 
 To manifest this dream job, he vowed to cultivate virtues through doing 3000 good deeds. Every day he practiced good deeds, studied virtuous books, and self-reflected in a journal. At first, he was able to do good deeds, but his mind and heart were not aligned. Later, his actions and mind were good, but his heart still didn't feel fully virtuous. In these situations, the manifestation will not work.
By the time he completed his 3000 good deeds, his heart had changed, so he could feel and maintain elevated emotions throughout the entire day, and his goal was indeed manifested. He then did vowed again to do 3000 deeds to have a son, and before his 3000 deeds were even finished, his son was born. 

 
Now that we realize that our every thought and emotion is influencing all the matter around us and attracting a specific reality from the Quantum Field, then we will naturally become more careful with our thoughts. There are endless implications, but here are some big ones
Health
Relationships
The Environment
World Peace
The rest of this article will detail these four areas.

Part 4: Manifesting Health
Both Western Medicine and  Traditional Chinese Medicine emphasize that emotions are one of the biggest factors for our health. 
From quantum physics, we understand that our thoughts and emotions are constantly changing the physical atoms around us, and the closest physical thing to our brain and heart is our body!

Here are some different ways to manifest more health in your life:
Cultivate virtues and cut vices
Daily mantra meditation 
Daily visualization meditation

Method 1: Cultivate Virtues and Cut Vices
We now know that virtues bring elevated emotions while vices bring low emotions. Dr. Masaru Emoto showed that our thoughts and emotions will change the way water crystalizes, and this is very relevant to our health because around 70% of our body is water.
We can even watch in real time a water crystal responding to calm and peaceful classical music:


Therefore, having virtuous thoughts and elevated emotions will make our body healthy, while vices and low emotions will make our bodies unhealthy.

Health Example 1: Venerable Jing Kong
Despite being in his 80s at the time, Venerable Buddhist Master Jing Kong looked so alive and had more energy than people in their 30s and 40s. His schedule was hectic, always flying to different countries to speak about world peace and morality education, but he never seemed to get tired even if he missed meals or barely slept. 
Many people asked him what his secret was. Did he eat anything special? Drink some sort of special tea? Do some sort of special exercise? His answer was simple: a compassionate heart and a peaceful mind. 

Venerable Jing Kong commented on Dr. Emoto’s experiments saying 
"Therefore, we should be happy and joyful with benevolent hearts, and always be mindful of repaying others’ kindness. Then the cells in our bodies will stay healthy. If we have anxieties, worries, hatred, fear, and confrontational minds against others, these will do serious harm to our bodies. If we want to be healthy, we must have good thoughts, say good words, and do good deeds. As a result, all the cells in our bodies will be healthy."

Method 2: Mantra Mediation
Jay Shetty, author of Think Like a Monk, explains a mantra to be a spiritual sound expressing thought and meaning that summons a power greater than ourselves. Chanting the mantra sound over and over again summons the power of sound.

Mantras have meaning, and knowing their meaning can help us bring forth the related elevated emotion, which is usually tranquility, love, or divinity. The more focused you are, the more powerful the effect. Dr. Emoto exposed water to various mantras and found their crystallization to be very beautiful.
Examples of common mantras include
Om (which means “infinite knowledge” or “everything”)
Hannya Shingyo (which means “heart of perfect wisdom”)
Om Ma Ni Bä Mê Hum (which means “let me be like the lotus, rising from impure mud yet untainted and pure.”)
Amitabha (which means infinite life and wisdom)
If you don’t like the idea of chanting some random sounds that you don’t understand, you can simply chant a word or phrase that you like over and over again, kind of like a personal motto. Here are some examples:
I can do it
Love and gratitude
Lotus flower 
“At your own pace, in your own time”
"I am happy about who I am becoming. I am open to all opportunities and possibilities. I am worthy of real love. I am ready to serve with all I have."
When doing your mantra meditation, just focus on the sound of the mantra and let that sound purify your mind and energy. If your mind wanders, simply notice and return back to the mantra. The goal is to cultivate elevated emotions related to your mantra, such as tranquility and love. You can do for 10 to 20 minutes, or however much time you have. You can also chant your mantra while doing mindless work like eating or walking or cleaning.

Health Example 2: 112 Year Old Monk
The old monk Venerable Hai Xian was basically a farmer who did physical labor out in the fields all day...at the age of 112!

Image Source 

That's a picture of him climbing a fruit tree to pick some fruits at the age of 112. Despite his age, his body and energy levels were the same as a healthy young person! Moreover, all he eats is stuff that he planted like taro, sweet potatoes, wheat, peanuts, and vegetables.

Most of us cannot fathom how that could be possible. Master Jing Kong explained that Venerable Hai Xian's secret is that his mind is always chanting "Namo Amitabha" no matter if he was doing farm work, eating, cleaning, walking, or listening to others talk. In other words, his electromagnetic field was always manifesting infinite life and infinite wisdom.

Inspired by his example, I also spend time every day to do concentrated mantra meditation where I recite "Amitabha" in my head over and over. I've personally experienced calming and healing effects, and I encourage everyone to try it too!

Method 3: Visualization Meditation
Visualization meditation is when we imagine something vividly in our mind such that it feels real to us right now. Dr. Dispenza says, 
"Something as simple as moving into an elevated state of joy, love, inspiration, or gratitude for five to ten minutes a day can produce significant epigenetic changes in your health and body."

Dr. Dispenza teaches his students to visualize their elevated self:
Observe your thoughts for any negative or limiting beliefs you have towards yourself. 
Let go of those negative emotions to the past.
Visualize your new, elevated self until it feels real. Imagine how that person would act and respond to daily interactions with elevated emotions.
Another type of mediation we can do is loving kindness meditation, which helps people to feel the elevated emotions of love and kindness. The basic procedure is 
Imagine someone or something that you love dearly. Maybe it is your parent, or grandparent, or pet, or child. 
Once you feel the love, imagine that love as a ball of energy coming outside your heart. Then let that loving energy grow and cover your whole body. 
Then send that energy to someone who you feel needs it or someone you feel negative emotions towards.
Keep meditating daily until you get the results
The loving kindness meditation will probably help you feel elevated emotions easier than the visualization, but the visualization has the benefit of helping you change your behavior throughout the day. 

Health Example 3: Miraculous Recovery from Cancer
In Overcoming the Habit of Being Yourself, Dr. Dispenza shares the story of someone named Bill. Bill developed cancer after 30 years of resentment, which came from giving up what he wanted for the sake of others. He then attended a two week meditation retreat with Dr. Dispenza. 

Step 1: Observe your thoughts for negative emotions
In the first week, he observed his thoughts, feelings, and unconscious thought patterns. He realized that he was holding onto emotional resentment in his unconscious mind without realizing it.

Step 2: Let go of those negative emotions to the past
After he realized this, he decided to stop any thought or behavior that was unloving toward himself. This decision helped him feel free, which released a lot of stuck energy in his body. 

Step 3: Visualize your new elevated self until it feels real
Then he visualized how his new self: If anyone expressed a request to him, he would respond with kindness and generosity, and he would not make anyone feel like a burden. He did the visualization until he felt like that new Bill right now. After he got up from the mediation, he maintained that elevated state.

Step 4: Keep mediating daily until you get the results
Bill kept up his focused meditations for the the two-week retreat. After he flew back home, his doctors discovered that his cancer was completely gone! Dr. Dispenza explains that those cancer cells couldn't coexist with the new Bill because those elevated emotions created a new body chemistry for Bill.


Part 5: Manifest Happy Relationships 
Relationships also have a health to them. If we want our relationships to be healthy, we need to send the other person (and the relationship) with lots of elevated emotions such as joy, gratitude, appreciation, and love. 

Marriage researcher Dr. John Gottman found that happy couples have at least 5 positive interactions for every negative interaction. He calls this "the magic ratio". Meanwhile, very happy couples have at least 20 positive interactions for every negative one. 

Dr. Gottman also found that the Four Horsemen that kill relationships are criticism, contempt, stonewalling, and defensiveness. These all relate to low and negative emotions and result in ugly water crystals.

When we maintain feelings of love, joy, and gratitude in our heart, then we will naturally act in accordance with those emotions, and the other person can't help but be influenced by our elevated emotions. Then the relationship will keep getting better. On the flip side, if we hold blame, resentment, and dissatisfaction in our hearts, our actions will reflect those emotions, and that will influence the other person for the worse. 


Example: Sending Elevated Emotions
In Becoming Supernatural, Dr. Dispenza describes experiments he did to prove that our electromagnetic fields affect other people’s emotions. He got a group of 550 to 1500 students together. Then he picked 50 to 75 people randomly to sit in the front of the room. 

During the meditation session, the people all cultivated and sustained an elevated emotion. Then he told all the students to send the energy of their elevated emotions into the space of the whole room. Additionally, he told them to have the intention of wanting the greatest good or the students sitting in the front rows, for their lives to be enriched, their bodies healed, and mystical experiences to find them.

The result? All those people sitting in the front row got coherent and elevated electromagnetic fields at the same time, in the same meditation, on the same day. They repeated this over and over and found consistent results, thereby proving that we can impact other people to feel elevated emotions with our elevated emotions.

Cultivate Emotional Mastery
You might be wondering, 
When the other person behaves badly or gets negative first, how can I not get upset?

This is a very legitimate question. After all, quantum physics explains that their thoughts and emotions will affect us too. The answer lies in cultivating the strength of our own thoughts and emotions to be more powerful than theirs. 
Yoga Master Sadhguru said,
 "If somebody else can decide what can happen within you right now, isn't this the ultimate slavery?"

American Nun Pema Chodron said,
"Inner peace begins the moment you choose not to allow another person or event to control your emotions."

Therefore, we need to cultivate mastery over our own emotions. Our elevated electromagnetic field needs to be stronger than their negative electromagnetic field. Then we can become unaffected by other people's negative emotions and instead positively affect them. That's why if an angry person goes up to an old monk, the old monk can calm him down just with his energy alone.

Two useful ways to remain unaffected by other people's negative energy is to be humble and grateful. When we possess these two virtues, we can reframe other people’s negativity into good things:
If they did something that made us upset, then they are teaching us that we are still a slave to the outside world, and so we can be grateful for their reminder. 
We probably have the same vice as them, so we can thank them for reminding us to not be like that. For example, if we don’t like them spreading their garbage to us, then we can see it as a reminder for us to not spread garbage to other people.
They are giving us a chance to practice the virtues of tolerance and tranquility. 
For a more detailed discussion on how to not get affected by other people’s garbage, check out the article Don’t Be A Garbage Truck.

Part 6: Manifest Healing the Environment
Our electromagnetic field does not only affect our body and the people around us, it actually affects the whole environment around us. When we send out elevated emotions to our environment, that can actually purify and clean our environment, including the water, air, and soil!

Example: Cleaning Polluted Water Using Thought
Dr. Emoto also showed that our thoughts can purify and clean polluted rivers. In one instance, he managed to conduct an experiment in a bay at Lake Biwa in Japan. The water in the bay had been polluted for 20 years and smelled terrible. 
 Dr. Emoto gathered over 100 people to pray by the bay, and the prayer was led by a monk who was over 90-years old. Specifically, the people were asked to sincerely and single-mindedly concentrate on one sentence, "Pure lake water, I love you". That's it. They did this for one hour. 
Image Source 

Three days later, the water in the bay became clean and pure, and the water crystals went from ugly to beautiful. This was very surprising even to Dr. Emoto, and it caught the attention of Japanese media. He managed to repeat the experiment for many other rivers in Japan, Korea, and Brazil.
The bay water at Lake Biwa actually remained clean for half a year, then the water became polluted again as before the experiment. Think about it: A 1-hour prayer session purified the dirty water for half a year. Dr. Emoto comments that if people came to pray to the water every month, the river would remain clean forever.

Part 7: Manifesting World Peace
In Becoming Supernatural, Dr. Dispenza says,
“To date, the power of temporary peace-gathering projects has been exhibited and thoroughly field tested in more than 50 demonstration projects and 23 peer-reviewed scientific studies scrutinized by independent scholars around the world. The results have consistently demonstrated a positive effect in the immediate reduction of crime, warfare, and terrorism by an average of greater than 70 percent.”

In other words, when a group of people gather to meditate or pray, their collective electromagnetic field can create a change in physical reality without them physically doing anything. The key is that they feel the emotions of peace, unity, and oneness. Furthermore, the studies found that the more meditators and the longer they meditated, the greater the reduction of crime and violence in society afterwards.


Example: Lebanon Peace Project
A group of mediators were brought together in Jerusalem in August and September of 1983. The group was often large enough to achieve a “super radiance effect” for both Israel and nearby Lebanon, and the result included
A 76% reduction of war deaths
Reduced crime 
Reduced fires 
Decreased traffic accidents 
Less terrorism 
Increased economic growth

These results were then replicated in seven more experiments over two years during the Lebanon war. All of this was the result of a large group of people combining their intention for peace (the electric part) with their emotions of love and compassion (the magnetic part) to create a powerful electromagnetic field that would fight against the electromagnetic field of the area.

Dr. Dispenza comments
“Can you imagine the results and positive effects, as well as the speed with which they would occur, if this type of meditation and mindfulness was a part of the education curriculum?”


Start with Yourself
Changing the world can be accomplished by us individually cultivating virtues and elevated emotions. We can also do daily meditation, whether that's visualization, loving-kindness, or mantra. Everything that helps us manifest health also helps to manifest a better world.

As Gandhi said, 
"If you want to change the world, start with yourself."

Conclusion
Everything in the physical world is actually made of non-physical waves. When the waves become dense enough, they become physical matter. Our thoughts and emotions are also waves, and they influence all the waves (and physical matter) around us. 

Image Source 

The stronger our elevated energy is, the greater the influence we can have on the matter around us, and the faster we can manifest our mind's intention. Most people have low emotions and weak energy, so they keep manifesting their current, non-ideal reality. 

The three keys to manifesting a better reality are 
Have deep concentration
Have elevated emotions (e.g., joy, gratitude, love) and get rid of low emotions (stress, fear, blame, victimization)
Maintain elevated emotions
Manifestation only works when what we think, feel, and do are constantly aligned.
 By cultivating our mind to become more virtuous, to think virtuous thoughts, speak virtuous words, and do virtuous deeds, then our virtuous energy will grow stronger and stronger each day, which will naturally manifest a better future.

We can use manifestation to create health, happy relationships, environment purification, and even world peace. Let's make good use of those 6000-70,000 thoughts per day!

Bertrand Russell: Mind and Matter (1950.11.10?)
★対訳版（English + Japanese)


Bertrand Russell Quotes 366
PLATO, reinforced by religion, has led mankind to accept the division of the known world into two categories mind and matter. Physics and psychology alike have begun to throw doubt on this dichotomy. It has begun to seem that matter, like the Cheshire Cat, is becoming gradually diaphanous until nothing of it is left but the grin, caused, presumably, by amusement at those who still think it is there. Mind, on the other hand, under the influence of brain surgery and of the fortunate opportunities provided by war for studying the effects of bullets embedded in cerebral tissue, has begun to appear more and more as a trivial by-product of certain kinds of physiological circumstances. This view has been reinforced by the morbid horror of introspection which besets those who fear that a private life, of no matter what kind, may expose them to the attentions of the police. We have thus a curiously paradoxical situation, reminding one of the duel between Hamlet and Laertes, in which students of physics have become idealists, while many psychologists are on the verge of materialism. The truth is, of course, that mind and matter are, alike, illusions. Physicists, who study matter, discover this fact about matter, psychologists, who study mind, discover this fact about mind. But each remains convinced that the other's subject of study must have some solidity. What I wish to do in this essay is to restate the relations of mind and brain in terms not implying the existence of either.
What one may call the conventional view has altered little since the days of the Cartesians. There is the brain, which acts according to the laws of physics; and there is the mind which, though it seems to have some laws of its own, is in many crucial ways subjected to physical conditions in the brain. The Cartesians supposed a parallelism according to which mind and brain were each determined by its own laws, but the two series were so related that, given an event in the one, it was sure to be accompanied by a corresponding event in the other. To take a simple analogy: suppose an Englishman and a Frenchman recite the Apostles' Creed, one in English, the other in French, at exactly the same speed, you can then, from what one of them is saying at a given moment in his language, infer what the other is saying in his. The two series run parallel, though neither causes the other. Few people would now adhere to this theory in its entirety. The denial of interaction between mind and brain contradicts common sense, and never had any but metaphysical arguments in its favor. We all know that a physical stimulus, such as being hit on the nose, may cause a mental reaction in this case of pain. And we all know that this mental reaction of pain may be the cause of a physical movement for example, of the fist. There are, however, two opposing schools, not so much of thought as of practice. One school has as its ideal a complete physical determinism as regards the material universe, combined with a dictionary stating that certain physical occurrences are invariably contemporary with certain mental occurrences. There is another school, of whom the psycho-analysts are the most influential part, which seeks purely psychological laws and does not aim at first establishing a causal skeleton in physics. The difference shows in the interpretation of dreams. If you have a nightmare, the one school will say that it is because you ate too much lobster salad, and the other that it is because you are unconsciously in love with your mother. Far be it from me to take sides in so bitter a debate; my own view would be that each type of explanation is justified where it succeeds. Indeed I should view the whole matter in a way which makes the controversy vanish, but before I can make this clear, there is need of a considerable amount of theoretical clarification.
Descartes, as everybody knows, says "I think, therefore I am," and he goes on at once, as if he had said nothing new, to assert "I am a thing that thinks." It would be difficult to pack so large a number of errors into so few words. To begin with "I think," the word "I" is thrust in to conform with grammar, and grammar embodies the metaphysic of our original Indo-European ancestors as they stammered round their campfires. We must, therefore, cut out the word "I." We will leave the word "think," but without a subject, since the subject embodies a belief in substance which we must shut out of our thoughts. The words "therefore I am" not only repeat the metaphysical sin embodied in the word "I," but commit the further sin, vigorously pilloried throughout the works of Carnap, of confounding a word in inverted commas with a word without inverted commas. When I say "I am," or "Socrates existed," or any similar statement, I am really saying something about the word "I" or the word "Socrates" --roughly speaking, in each case that this word is a name. For it is obvious that, if you think of all the things that there are in the world, they cannot be divided into two classes --namely, those that exist, and those that do not. Non-existence, in fact, is a very rare property. Everybody knows the story of the two German pessimistic philosophers, of whom one exclaimed: "How much happier were it never to have been born." To which the other replied with a sigh: "True! But how few are those who achieve this happy lot." You cannot, in fact, say significantly of anything that it exists. What you can say significantly is that the word denoting it denotes something, which is not true of such a word as "Hamlet." Every statement about Hamlet in the play has implicit the false statement " 'Hamlet' is a name," and that is why you cannot take the play as part of Danish history. So when Descartes says "I am," what he ought to mean is " T is a name" --doubtless a very interesting statement, but not having all the metaphysical consequences which Descartes wishes to draw from it. These, however, are not the mistakes I wish to emphasize in Descartes' philosophy. What I wish to emphasize is the error involved in saying "I am a thing that thinks." Here the substance philosophy is assumed. It is assumed that the world consists of more or less permanent objects with changing states. This view was evolved by the original metaphysicians who invented language, and who were much struck by the difference between their enemy in battle and their enemy after he had been slain, although they were persuaded that it was the same person whom they first feared, and then ate. It is from such origins that common sense derives its tenets. And I regret to say that all too many professors of philosophy consider it their duty to be sycophants of common sense, and thus, doubtless unintentionally, to bow down in homage before the savage superstitions of cannibals.
What ought we to substitute for Descartes' belief that he was a thing that thought? There were, of course, two Descartes, the distinction between whom is what gives rise to the problem I wish to discuss. There was Descartes to himself, and Descartes to his friends. He is concerned with what he was to himself. What he was to himself is not best described as a single entity with changing states. The single entity is quite otiose. The changing states suffice. Descartes to himself should have appeared as a series of events, each of which might be called a thought, provided that word is liberally interpreted. What he was to others I will, for the moment, ignore. It was this series of "thoughts" which constituted Descartes' "mind," but his mind was no more a separate entity than the population of New York is a separate entity over and above the several inhabitants. Instead of saying "Descartes thinks," we ought to say "Descartes is a series of which the members are thoughts." And instead of "therefore Descartes exists," we ought to say "Since 'Descartes' is the name of this series, it follows that 'Descartes' is a name." But for the statement "Descartes is a thing which thinks" we must substitute nothing whatever, since the statement embodies nothing but faulty syntax.
It is time to inquire what we mean by "thoughts" when we say that Descartes was a series of thoughts. It would be more conventionally correct to say that Descartes' mind was a series of thoughts, since his body is generally supposed to have been something different. His mind, we may say, was what Descartes was to himself and to no one else; whereas his body was public, and appeared to others as well as to himself. Descartes uses the word "thoughts" somewhat more widely than it would be used nowadays, and we shall, perhaps, avoid confusion if we substitute the phrase "mental phenomena." Before we reach what would ordinarily be called "thinking," there are more elementary occurrences, which come under the heads of "sensation" and "perception." Common sense would say that perception always has an object, and that in general the object of perception is not mental. Sensation and perception would, in common parlance, not count as "thoughts." Thoughts would consist of such occurrences as memories, beliefs, and desires. Before considering thoughts in this narrower sense, I should wish to say a few words about sensation and perception.
Both "sensation" and "perception" are somewhat confused concepts, and, as ordinarily defined, it may be doubted whether either ever occurs. Let us, therefore, in the first instance avoid the use of these words, and try to describe what occurs with as few doubtful assumptions as possible.
It frequently happens that a number of people in the same environment have very similar experiences at approximately the same time. A number of people can hear the same clap of thunder, or the same speech by a politician; and the same people can see the lightning, or the politician thumping the table. We become aware on reflection that there is, in the environment of these people, an event which is not identical with what is heard or seen. There is only one politician, but there is a separate mental occurrence in each of those who see and hear him. In this mental occurrence, psychological analysis distinguishes two elements: one of them is due to those parts of the structure of the individual which he shares with other normal members of his species; the other part embodies results of his past experiences. A certain phrase of the politician evokes in one hearer the reaction "That's put the scoundrels in their place," and in another the quite different reaction, "Never in all my life have I heard such monstrous injustice." Not only such somewhat indirect reactions are different, but often men will actually hear different words because of their prejudices or past experiences. I was present in the House of Lords on an occasion when Keynes felt it necessary to rebuke Lord Beaverbrook for some statistics that the noble journalist had been offering to the House. What Keynes said was: "I have never heard statistics so phony" or "funny." Half the House thought he said "phony," and the other half thought he said "funny." He died almost immediately afterward, leaving the question undecided. No doubt past experience determined which of the two words any given hearer heard. Those who had been much exposed to America heard "phony," while those who had led more sheltered lives heard "funny." But in all ordinary cases past experience is concerned much more intimately than in the above illustration. When you see a solid-looking object, it suggests tactile images. If you are accustomed to pianos, but not to gramophones or radio, you will, when you hear piano music, imagine the hands of the performer on the keys (I have had this experience, but it is one not open to the young). When in the morning you smell bacon, gustatory images inevitably arise. The word "sensation" is supposed to apply to that part of the mental occurrence which is not due to past individual experience, while the word "perception" applies to the sensation together with adjuncts that the past history of the individual has rendered inevitable. It is clear that to disentangle the part of the total experience which is to be called "sensation," is a matter of elaborate psychological theory. What we know without theory is the total occurrence which is a "perception."
But the word "perception," as ordinarily used, is question-begging. Suppose, for example, that I see a chair, or rather that there is an occurrence which would ordinarily be so described. The phrase is taken to imply that there is "I" and there is a chair, and that the perceiving is a relation between the two. I have already dealt with "I," but the chair belongs to the physical world, which, for the moment, I am trying to ignore. For the moment I will say only this: common sense supposes that the chair which I perceive would still be there if I did not perceive it, for example, if I shut my eyes. Physics and physiology between them assure me that what is there independently of my seeing, is something very unlike a visual experience, namely, a mad dance of billions of electrons undergoing billions of quantum transitions. My relation to this object is indirect, and is known only by inference; it is not something that I directly experience whenever there is that occurrence which I call "seeing a chair." In fact the whole of what occurs when I have the experience which I call "seeing a chair" is to be counted as belonging to my mental world. If there is a chair which is outside my mental world, as I firmly believe, this is something which is not a direct object of experience, but is arrived at by a process of inference. This conclusion has odd consequences. We must distinguish between the physical world of physics, and the physical world of our everyday experience. The physical world of physics, supposing physics to be correct, exists independently of my mental life. From a metaphysical point of view, it is solid and self-subsistent, always assuming that there is such a world. Per contra, the physical world of my everyday experience is a part of my mental life. Unlike the physical world of physics, it is not solid, and is no more substantial than the world that I see in dreams. On the other hand it is indubitable, in a way in which the physical world of physics is not. The experience of seeing a chair is one that I cannot explain away. I certainly have this experience, even if I am dreaming. But the chair of physics, though certainly solid, perhaps does not exist. It does not exist if I am dreaming. And even if I am awake it may not exist, if there are fallacies in certain kinds of inference to which I am prone, but which are not demonstrative. In short, as Mr. Micawber would say, the physical world of physics is solid but not indubitable, while the physical world of daily experience is indubitable but not solid. In this statement I am using the word "solid" to mean "existing independently of my mental life."
Let us ask ourselves a very elementary question: What is the difference between things that happen to sentient beings and things that happen to lifeless matter? Obviously all sorts of things happen to lifeless objects. They move and undergo various transformations, but they do not "experience" these occurrences whereas we do "experience" things that happen to us. Most philosophers have treated "experience" as something indefinable, of which the meaning is obvious. I regard this as a mistake. I do not think the meaning is obvious, but I also do not think that it is indefinable. What characterizes experience is the influence of past occurrences on present reactions. When you offer a coin to an automatic machine, it reacts precisely as it has done on former occasions. It does not get to know that the offer of a coin means a desire for a ticket, or whatever it may be, and it reacts no more promptly than it did before. The man at the ticket office, on the contrary, learns from experience to react more quickly and to less direct stimuli. This is what leads us to call him intelligent. It is this sort of thing which is the essence of memory. You see a certain person, and he makes a certain remark. The next time you see him you remember the remark. This is essentially analogous to the fact that when you see an object which looks hard, you expect a certain kind of tactile sensation if you touch it. It is this sort of thing that distinguishes an experience from a mere happening. The automatic machine has no experience; the man at the ticket office has experience. This means that a given stimulus produces always the same reaction in the machine, but different reactions in the man. You tell an anedote, and your hearer replies: "You should have heard how I laughed the first time I heard the story." If, however, you had constructed an automatic machine that would laugh at a joke, it could be relied upon to laugh every time, however often it had heard the joke before. You may, perhaps, find this thought comforting if you are tempted to adopt a materialistic philosophy.
I think it would be just to say that the most essential characteristic of mind is memory, using this word in its broadest sense to include every influence of past experience on present reactions. Memory includes the sort of knowledge which is commonly called knowledge of perception. When you merely see something it can hardly count as knowledge. It becomes knowledge when you say to yourself that you see it, or that there it is. This is a reflection upon the mere seeing. This reflection is knowledge, and because it is possible, the seeing counts as experience and not as a mere occurrence, such as might happen to a stone. The influence of past experience is embodied in the principle of the conditioned reflex, which says that, in suitable circumstances, if A originally produces a certain reaction, and A frequently occurs in conjunction with B, B alone will ultimately produce the reaction that A originally produced. For example: if you wish to teach bears to dance, you place them upon a platform so hot that they cannot bear to leave a foot on it for more than a moment, and meanwhile you play "Rule Britannia" on the orchestra. After a time "Rule Britannia" alone will make them dance. Our intellectual life, even in its highest flights, is based upon this principle.
Like all other distinctions, the distinction between what is living and what is dead is not absolute. There are viruses concerning which specialists cannot make up their minds whether to call them living or dead, and the principle of the conditioned reflex, though characteristic of what is living, finds some exemplification in other spheres. For example: if you unroll a roll of paper, it will roll itself up again as soon as it can. But in spite of such cases, we may take the conditioned reflex as characteristic of life, especially in its higher forms, and above all as characteristic of human intelligence. The relation between mind and matter comes to a head at this point. If the brain is to have any characteristic corresponding to memory, it must be in some way affected by what happens to it, in such a manner as to suggest reproduction on occasion of a suitable stimulus. This also can be illustrated in a lesser degree by the behavior of inorganic matter. A watercourse which at most times is dry gradually wears a channel down a gully at the times when it flows, and subsequent rains follow the course which is reminiscent of earlier torrents. You may say, if you like, that the river bed "remembers" previous occasions when it experienced cooling streams. This would be considered a flight of fancy. You would say it was a flight of fancy because you are of the opinion that rivers and river beds do not "think." But if thinking consists of certain modifications of behavior owing to former occurrences, then we shall have to say that the river bed thinks, though its thinking is somewhat rudimentary. You cannot teach it the multiplication table, however wet the climate may be.
At this point I fear you will be becoming indignant. You will be inclined to say: "But, my dear Sir, how can you be so dense? Surely even you must know that thoughts and pleasures and pains cannot be pushed about like billiard balls, whereas matter can. Matter occupies space. It is impenetrable; it is hard (unless it is soft); thoughts are not like this. You cannot play billiards with your thoughts. When you banish a thought, the process is quite different from that of being ejected by the police. You, of course, as a philosopher" (so, no doubt, you will continue) "are superior to all human passions. But the rest of us experience pleasures and pains, and sticks and stones do not. In view of all this I cannot understand how you can be so stupid as to make a mystery of the difference between mind and matter."
My answer to this consists in saying that I know very much less than you do about matter. All that I know about matter is what I can infer by means of certain abstract postulates about the purely logical attributes of its space-time distribution, Prima facie, these tell me nothing whatever about its other characteristics. Moreover there are the same reasons for not admitting the concept of substance in the case of matter, as there are in the case of mind. We reduced Descartes' mind to a series of occurrences, and we must do the same for his body. A piece of matter is a series of occurrences bound together by means of certain of the laws of physics. The laws that bind these occurrences together are only approximate and macroscopic. In proper quantum physics, the identity which physical particles preserve in old-fashioned physics disappears. Suppose I want to say: "This is the same chair as it was yesterday." You cannot expect me to tell you accurately what I mean, because it would take volumes to state this correctly. What I mean may be put roughly as follows: classical physics a system now abandoned worked with the assumption of particles that persist through time. While this conception lasted, I could maintain that when I said "This is the same chair" I meant "this is composed of the same particles." Before the coming of quantum physics, particles were already out of date, because they involved the concept of substance. But that did not matter so much because it was still possible to define a particle as a certain series of physical occurrences, connected with one another by the law of inertia and other similar principles. Even in the days of the Rutherford-Bohr atom, this point of view could still be maintained. The Rutherford-Bohr atom consisted of a certain number of electrons and protons. The electrons behaved like fleas. They crawled for a while, and then hopped. But an electron was still recognizable after the hops as being the same one that had previously crawled. Now, alas, the atom has suffered atomic disintegration. All that we know about it, even on the most optimistic hypothesis, is that it is a distribution of energy which undergoes various sudden transitions. It is only the transitions of which it is possible to have evidence, for it is only in a transition that energy is radiated, it is only when energy is radiated that our senses are affected, and it is only when our senses are affected that we have evidence as to what has occurred. In the happy days when Bohr was young, we were supposed to know what was going on in the atom in quiet times: there were electrons going round and round the nucleus as planets go round the sun. Now we have to confess to a complete and absolute and eternally ineradicable ignorance as to what the atom does in quiet times. It is as if it were inhabited by newspaper reporters who think nothing worth mentioning except revolutions, so that what happens when no revolution is going on remains wrapped in mystery. On this basis, sameness at different times has completely disappeared. If you want to explain what you mean in physics when you say "This is the same chair as it was yesterday," you must go back to classical physics. You must say: when temperatures are not too high, and chemical circumstances are ordinary, the results obtained by old-fashioned classical physics are more or less right. And when I say that "this is the same chair", I shall mean that old-fashioned physics would say it was the same chair. But I am well aware that this is no more than a convenient and inaccurate way of speaking, and that, in fact, every smallest piece of the chair loses its identity in about one hundred thousandth part of a second. To say that it is the same chair is like saying that the English are the same nation as they were in the time of Queen Elizabeth I, or rather, like what this would be, if many millions of generations had passed since the death of Good Queen Bess.
We have not yet learned to talk about the human brain in the accurate language of quantum physics. Indeed we know too little about it for this language to be necessary. The chief relevance, to our problem, of the mysteries of quantum physics consists in their showing us how very little we know about matter, and, in particular, about human brains. Some physiologists still imagine that they can look through a microscope and see brain tissues. This, of course, is an optimistic delusion. When you think that you look at a chair, you do not see quantum transitions. You have an experience which has a very lengthy and elaborate causal connection with the physical chair, a connection proceeding through photons, rods and cones, and optic nerve to the brain. All these stages are necessary if you are to have the visual experience which is called "seeing the chair." You may stop the photons by closing your eyes, the optic nerve may be severed, or the appropriate part of the brain may be destroyed by a bullet. If any of these things has happened you will not "see the chair." Similar considerations apply to the brain that the physiologist thinks he is examining. There is an experience in him which has a remote causal connection with the brain that he thinks he is seeing. He can only know concerning that brain such elements of structure as will be reproduced in his visual sensation. Concerning properties that are not structural, he can know nothing whatever. He has no right to say that the contents of a brain are different from those of the mind that goes with it. If it is a living brain, he has evidence through testimony and analogy that there is a mind that goes with it. If it is a dead brain, evidence is lacking either way.
I wish to suggest, as a hypothesis which is simple and unifying though not demonstrable, a theory which I prefer to that of correspondence advanced by the Cartesians. We have agreed that mind and matter alike consist of series of events. We have also agreed that we know nothing about the events that make matter, except their space-time structure. What I suggest is that the events that make a living brain are actually identical with those that make the corresponding mind. All the reasons that will naturally occur to you for rejecting this view depend upon confusing material objects with those that you experience in sight and touch. These latter are parts of your mind. I can see, at the moment, if I allow myself to talk the language of common sense, the furniture of my room, the trees waving in the wind, houses, clouds, blue sky, and sun. All these common sense imagines to be outside me. All these I believe to be causally connected with physical objects which are outside me, but as soon as I realize that the physical objects must differ in important ways from what I directly experience, and as soon as I take account of the causal trains that proceed from the physical object to my brain before my sensations occur, I see that from the point of view of physical causation the immediately experienced objects of sense are in my brain and not in the outer world. Kant was right to put the starry heavens and the moral law together, since both were figments of his brain.
If what I am saying is correct, the difference between mind and brain does not consist in the raw material of which they are composed, but in the manner of grouping. A mind and a piece of matter alike are to be considered as groups of events, or rather series of groups of events. The events that are grouped to make a given mind are, according to my theory, the very same events that are grouped to make its brain. Or perhaps it would be more correct to say that they are some of the events that make the brain. The important point is, that the difference between mind and brain is not a difference of quality, but a difference of arrangement. It is like the difference between arranging people in geographical order or in alphabetical order, both of which are done in the post office directory. The same people are arranged in both cases, but in quite different contexts. In like manner the context of a visual sensation for physics is physical, and outside the brain. Going backward, it takes you to the eye, and thence to a photon and thence to a quantum transition in some distant object. The context of the visual sensation for psychology is quite different. Suppose, for example, the visual sensation is that of a telegram saying that you are ruined. A number of events will take place in your mind in accordance with the laws of psychological causation, and it may be quite a long time before there is any purely physical effect, such as tearing your hair, or exclaiming "Woe is me!"
If this theory is right, certain kinds of connection between mind and brain are inescapable. Corresponding to memory, for example, there must be some physical modifying of the brain, and mental life must be connected with physical properties of the brain tissue. In fact, if we had more knowledge, the physical and psychological statements would be seen to be merely different ways of saying the same thing. The ancient question of the dependence of mind on brain, or brain on mind, is thus reduced to linguistic convenience. In cases where we know more about the brain it will be convenient to regard the mind as dependent, but in cases where we know more about the mind it will be convenient to regard the brain as dependent. In either case, the substantial facts are the same, and the difference is only as to the degree of our knowledge.
I do not think it can be laid down absolutely, if the above is right, that there can be no such thing as disembodied mind. There would be disembodied mind if there were groups of events connected according to the laws of psychology, but not according to the laws of physics. We readily believe that dead matter consists of groups of events arranged according to the laws of physics, but not according to the laws of psychology. And there seems no a priori reason why the opposite should not occur. We can say we have no empirical evidence of it, but more than this we cannot say.
Experience has shown me that the theory which I have been trying to set forth is one which people are very apt to misunderstand, and, as misunderstood, it becomes absurd. I will therefore recapitulate its main points in the hope that by means of new wording they may become less obscure.
First: the world is composed of events, not of things with changing states, or rather, everything that we have a right to say about the world can be said on the assumption that there are only events and not things. Things, as opposed to events, are an unnecessary hypothesis. This part of what I have to say is not exactly new, since it was said by Heraclitus. His view, however, annoyed Plato and has therefore ever since been considered not quite gentlemanly. In these democratic days this consideration need not frighten us. Two kinds of supposed entities are dissolved if we adopt the view of Heraclitus: on the one hand, persons, and on the other hand, material objects. Grammar suggests that you and I are more or less permanent entities with changing states, but the permanent entities are unnecessary, and the changing states suffice for saying all that we know on the matter. Exactly the same sort of thing applies to physical objects. If you go into a shop and buy a loaf of bread, you think that you have bought a "thing" which you can bring home with you. What you have in fact bought is a series of occurrences linked together by certain causal laws.
Second: sensible objects, as immediately experienced, that is to say, what we see when we see chairs and tables and the sun and the moon and so on, are parts of our minds and are not either the whole or part of the physical objects that we think we are seeing. This part of what I am saying is also not new. It comes from Berkeley, as reinforced by Hume. The arguments that I should use for it, however, are not exactly Berkeley's. I should point out that if a number of people look at a single object from different points of view, their visual impressions differ according to the laws of perspective and according to the way the light falls. Therefore no one of the visual impressions is that neutral "thing" which all think they are seeing. I should point out also that physics leads us to believe in causal chains, starting from objects and reaching our sense organs, and that it would be very odd if the last link in this causal chain were exactly like the first.
Third: I should admit that there may be no such thing as a physical world distinct from my experiences, but I should point out that if the inferences which lead to matter are rejected, I ought also to reject the inferences which lead me to believe in my own mental past. I should point out further that no one sincerely rejects beliefs which only such inferences can justify. I therefore take it that there are events which I do not experience, although some things about some of these can be inferred from what I do experience. Except where mental phenomena are concerned, the inferences that I can make as to the external causes of my experiences are only as to structure, not as to quality. The inferences that are warranted are those to be found in theoretical physics; they are abstract and mathematical and give no indication whatever as to the intrinsic character of physical objects.
Fourth: if the foregoing is accepted there must be two sorts of space, one the sort of space which is known through experience, especially in my visual field, the other the sort of space that occurs in physics, which is known only by inference and is bound up with causal laws. Failure to distinguish these two kinds of space is a source of much confusion. I will take again the case of a physiologist who is examining someone else's brain. Common sense supposes that he sees that brain and that what he sees is matter. Since what he sees is obviously quite different from what is being thought by the patient whom he is examining, people conclude that mind and matter are quite different things. Matter is what the physiologist sees, mind is what the patient is thinking. But this whole order of ideas, if I am right, is a mass of confusions. What the physiologist sees, if we mean by this something that he experiences, is an event in his own mind and has only an elaborate causal connection with the brain that he imagines himself to be seeing. This is obvious as soon as we think of physics. In the brain that he thinks he is seeing there are quantum transitions. These lead to emission of photons, the photons travel across the intervening space and hit the eye of the physiologist. They then cause complicated occurrences in the rods and cones, and a disturbance which travels along the optic nerve to the brain. When this disturbance reaches the brain, the physiologist has the experience which is called "seeing the other man's brain." If anything interferes with the causal chain, e.g. because the other man's brain is in darkness, because the physiologist has closed his eyes, because the physiologist is blind, or because he has a bullet in the brain at the optic center, he does not have the experience called "seeing the other man's brain." Nor does the event occur at the same time as what he thinks he sees. In the case of terrestrial objects, the difference of time is negligible, but in the case of celestial objects it may be very large, even as much as millions of years. The relation of a visual experience to the physical object that common sense thinks it is seeing is thus indirect and causal, and there is no reason to suppose that close similarity between them that common sense imagines to exist. All this is connected with the two kinds of space that I wrote of a moment ago. I horrified all the philosophers by saying that their thoughts were in their heads. With one voice they assured me that they had no thoughts in their heads whatever, but politeness forbids me to accept this assurance. Perhaps, however, it might be well to explain exactly what I mean, since the remark is elliptical. Stated accurately, what I mean is as follows: physical space, unlike the space of perception, is based upon causal contiguity. The causal contiguities of sense perceptions are with the physical stimuli immediately preceding them and with the physical reactions immediately following them. Precise location in physical space belongs not to single events but to such groups of events as physics would regard as a momentary state of a piece of matter, if it indulged in such old-fashioned language. A thought is one of a group of events, such as will count for purposes of physics as a region in the brain. To say that a thought is in the brain is an abbreviation for the following: a thought is one of a group of compresent events, which group is a region in the brain. I am not suggesting that thoughts are in psychological space, except in the case of sense impressions (if these are to be called "thoughts")
Fifth: a piece of matter is a group of events connected by causal laws, namely, the causal laws of physics. A mind is a group of events connected by causal laws, namely, the causal laws of psychology. An event is not rendered either mental or material by any intrinsic quality, but only by its causal relations. It is perfectly possible for an event to have both the causal relations characteristic of physics and those characteristic of psychology. In that case, the event is both mental and material at once. There is no more difficulty about this than there is about a man being at once a baker and a father. Since we know nothing about the intrinsic quality of physical events except when these are mental events that we directly experience, we cannot say either that the physical world outside our heads is different from the mental world or that it is not. The supposed problem of the relations of mind and matter arises only through mistakenly treating both as "things" and not as groups of events. With the theory that I have been suggesting, the whole problem vanishes.
In favor of the theory that I have been advocating, the most important thing to be said is that it removes a mystery. Mystery is always annoying, and is usually due to lack of clear analysis. The relations of mind and matter have puzzled people for a long time, but if I am right they need puzzle people no longer.

Descartes and the Discovery of the Mind-Body Problem
The French philosopher René Descartes is often credited with discovering the mind-body problem, a mystery that haunts philosophers to this day. The reality is more complicated than that.
By: Jonathan Westphal
Consider the human body, with everything in it, including internal and external organs and parts — the stomach, nerves and brain, arms, legs, eyes, and all the rest. Even with all this equipment, especially the sensory organs, it is surprising that we can consciously perceive things in the world that are far away from us. For example, I can open my eyes in the morning and see a cup of coffee waiting for me on the bedside table. There it is, a foot away, and I am not touching it, yet somehow it is making itself manifest to me. How does it happen that I see it? How does the visual system convey to my awareness or mind the image of the cup of coffee?
This article is adapted from Jonathan Westphal’s book “The Mind-Body Problem,” part of the MIT Press Essential Knowledge series.
The answer is not particularly simple. Very roughly, the physical story is that light enters my eyes from the cup of coffee, and this light impinges on the two retinas at the backs of the eyes. Then, as we have learned from physiological science, the two retinas send electrical signals past the optic chiasm down the optic nerve. These signals are conveyed to the so-called visual cortex at the back of the brain. And then there is a sort of a miracle. The visual cortex becomes active, and I see the coffee cup. I am conscious of the cup, we might even say, though it is not clear what this means and how it differs from saying that I see the cup.
One minute there are just neurons firing away, and no image of the cup of coffee. The next, there it is; I see the cup of coffee, a foot away. How did my neurons contact me or my mind or consciousness, and stamp there the image of the cup of coffee for me?
It’s a mystery. That mystery is the mind-body problem.
Our mind-body problem is not just a difficulty about how the mind and body are related and how they affect one another. It is also a difficulty about how they can be related and how they can affect one another. Their characteristic properties are very different, like oil and water, which simply won’t mix, given what they are.
There is a very common view which states that the French philosopher René Descartes discovered, or invented, this problem in the 17th century. According to Descartes, matter is essentially spatial, and it has the characteristic properties of linear dimensionality. Things in space have a position, at least, and a height, a depth, and a length, or one or more of these. Mental entities, on the other hand, do not have these characteristics. We cannot say that a mind is a two-by-two-by-two-inch cube or a sphere with a two-inch radius, for example, located in a position in space inside the skull. This is not because it has some other shape in space, but because it is not characterized by space at all.
The difficulty is not merely that mind and body are different. It is that they are different in such a way that their interaction is impossible.
What is characteristic of a mind, Descartes claims, is that it is conscious, not that it has shape or consists of physical matter. Unlike the brain, which has physical characteristics and occupies space, it does not seem to make sense to attach spatial descriptions to it. In short, our bodies are certainly in space, and our minds are not, in the very straightforward sense that the assignation of linear dimensions and locations to them or to their contents and activities is unintelligible. That this straightforward test of physicality has survived all the philosophical changes of opinion since Descartes, almost unscathed, is remarkable.
This issue aroused considerable interest following the publication of Descartes’s 1641 treatise “Meditations on First Philosophy,” the first edition of which included both Objections to Descartes, written by a group of distinguished contemporaries, and the philosopher’s own Replies. Though we do find in the “Meditations” itself the distinction between mind and body, drawn very sharply by Descartes, in fact he makes no mention of our mind-body problem. Descartes is untroubled by the fact that, as he has described them, mind and matter are very different: One is spatial and the other not, and therefore one cannot act upon the other. Descartes himself writes in his Reply to one of the Objections:
The whole problem contained in such questions arises simply from a supposition that is false and cannot in any way be proved, namely that, if the soul and the body are two substances whose nature is different, this prevents them from being able to act on each other.
Descartes is surely right about this. The “nature” of a baked Alaska pudding, for instance, is very different from that of a human being, since one is a pudding and the other is a human being — but the two can “act on each other” without difficulty, for example when the human being consumes the baked Alaska pudding and the baked Alaska in return gives the human being a stomachache.
Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia questioned Descartes’ idea of the mind-body dualism, exposing the weakness of his views.
The difficulty, however, is not merely that mind and body are different. It is that they are different in such a way that their interaction is impossible because it involves a contradiction. It is the nature of bodies to be in space, and the nature of minds not to be in space, Descartes claims. For the two to interact, what is not in space must act on what is in space. Action on a body takes place at a position in space, however, where the body is. Apparently Descartes did not see this problem. It was, however, clearly stated by two of his critics, the philosophers Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia and Pierre Gassendi. They pointed out that if the soul is to affect the body, it must make contact with the body, and to do that it must be in space and have extension. In that case, the soul is physical, by Descartes’s own criterion.
In a letter dated May 1643, Princess Elisabeth wrote to Descartes,
I beg you to tell me how the human soul can determine the movement of the animal spirits in the body so as to perform voluntary acts—being as it is merely a conscious substance. For the determination of the movement seems always to come about from the moving body’s being propelled—to depend on the kind of impulse it gets from what it sets in motion, or again, on the nature and shape of this latter thing’s surface. Now the first two conditions involve contact, and the third involves that the impelling [thing] has extension; but you utterly exclude extension from your notion of soul, and contact seems to me incompatible with a thing’s being immaterial.
Propulsion and “the kind of impulse” that set the body in motion require contact, and “the nature and shape” of the surface of the site at which contact is made with the body require extension. We need two further clarifications to grasp this passage.
The first is that when Princess Elisabeth and Descartes mention “animal spirits” (the phrase is from the ancient Greek physician and philosopher Galen) they are writing about something that plays roughly the role of signals in the nerve fibers of modern physiology. For Descartes, the animal spirits were not spirits in the sense of ghostly apparitions, but part of a theory that claimed that muscles were moved by inflation with air, the so-called balloonist theory. The animal spirits were fine streams of air that inflated the muscles. (“Animal” does not mean the beasts here, but is an adjective derived from “anima,” the soul.)
The second clarification is that when Princess Elisabeth writes that “you utterly exclude extension from your notion of soul,” she is referring to the fact that Descartes defines mind and matter in such a way that the two are mutually exclusive. Mind is consciousness, which has no extension or spatial dimension, and matter is not conscious, since it is completely defined by its spatial dimensions and location. Since mind lacks a location and spatial dimensions, Elisabeth is arguing, it cannot make contact with matter. Here we have the mind-body problem going at full throttle.
It was Descartes’ critics who discovered the problem, right in his solution to it.
Descartes himself did not yet have the mind-body problem; he had something that amounted to a solution to the problem. It was his critics who discovered the problem, right in Descartes’s solution to the problem, although it is also true that it was almost forced on them by Descartes’s sharp distinction between mind and body. The distinction involved the defining characteristics or “principal attributes,” as he called them, of mind and body, which are consciousness and extension.
Though Descartes was no doubt right that very different kinds of things can interact with one another, he was not right in his account of how such different things as mind and body do in fact interact. His proposal, in “The Passions of the Soul,” his final philosophical treatise, was that they interact through the pineal gland, which is, he writes, “the principal seat of the soul” and is moved this way and that by the soul so as to move the animal spirits or streams of air from the sacs next to it. He had his reasons for choosing this organ, as the pineal gland is small, light, not bilaterally doubled, and centrally located. Still, the whole idea is a nonstarter, because the pineal gland is as physical as any other part of the body. If there is a problem about how the mind can act on the body, the same problem will exist about how the mind can act on the pineal gland, even if there is a good story to tell about the hydraulics of the “pneumatic” (or nervous) system.
We have inherited the sharp distinction between mind and body, though not exactly in Descartes’s form, but we have not inherited Descartes’s solution to the mind-body problem. So we are left with the problem, minus a solution. We see that the experiences we have, such as experiences of color, are indeed very different from the electromagnetic radiation that ultimately produces them, or from the activity of the neurons in the brain. We are bound to wonder how the uncolored radiation can produce the color, even if its effects can be followed as far as the neurons in the visual cortex. In other words, we make a sharp distinction between physics and physiology on the one hand, and psychology on the other, without a principled way to connect them. Physics consists of a set of concepts that includes mass, velocity, electron, wave, and so on, but does not include the concepts red, yellow, black, and the like. Physiology includes the concepts neuron, glial cell, visual cortex, and so on, but does not include the concept of color. In the framework of current scientific theory, “red” is a psychological term, not a physical one. Then our problem can be very generally described as the difficulty of describing the relationship between the physical and the psychological, since, as Princess Elisabeth and Gassendi realized, they possess no common relating terms.
Was there really no mind-body problem before Descartes and his debate with his critics in 1641? Of course, long before Descartes, philosophers and religious thinkers had spoken about the body and the mind or soul, and their relationship. Plato, for example, wrote a fascinating dialogue, the Phaedo, which contains arguments for the survival of the soul after death, and for its immortality. Yet the exact sense in which the soul or mind is able to be “in” the body, and also to leave it, is apparently not something that presented itself to Plato as a problem in its own right. His interest is in the fact that the soul survives death, not how, or in what sense it can be in the body. The same is true of religious thinkers. Their concern is for the human being, and perhaps for the welfare of the body, but mainly for the welfare and future of the human soul. They do not formulate a problem with the technical precision that was forced on Princess Elisabeth and Gassendi by Descartes’s neatly formulated dualism.
Something important clearly had changed in our intellectual orientation during the mid-17th century. Mechanical explanations had become the order of the day, such as Descartes’s balloonist explanation of the nervous system, and these explanations left unanswered the question of what should be said about the human mind and human consciousness from the physical and mechanical point of view.
What happens, if anything, for example, when we decide to do even such a simple thing as to lift up a cup and take a sip of coffee? The arm moves, but it is difficult to see how the thought or desire could make that happen. It is as though a ghost were to try to lift up a coffee cup. Its ghostly arm would, one supposes, simply pass through the cup without affecting it and without being able to cause it or the physical arm to go up in the air.
It would be no less remarkable if merely by thinking about it from a few feet away we could cause an ATM to dispense cash. It is no use insisting that our minds are after all not physically connected to the ATM, and that is why it is impossible to affect the ATM’s output — for there is no sense in which they are physically connected to our bodies. Our minds are not physically connected to our bodies! How could they be, if they are nonphysical? That is the point whose importance Princess Elisabeth and Gassendi saw more clearly than anyone had before them, including Descartes himself.
