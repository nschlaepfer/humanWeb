## Web Searching Bot

The Web Searching Bot is a Python-based application designed to browse the internet as if it were a user. It navigates through web pages, follows links, and extracts relevant information based on user-defined criteria. The bot is designed to overcome common web crawling issues such as rate limits.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Pip (Python package installer)
- Google Chrome Browser (for Selenium WebDriver)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

1. Start the Flask server:

```bash
python app.py
```

2. (Optional) If you're using the frontend interface, navigate to the frontend directory and start the React app:

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

3. Use the application via the frontend interface or by sending requests to the Flask server.

### Components

- **Web Crawler:** Uses Selenium to simulate a real user's behavior, such as clicking on links and scrolling through pages.
- **Data Extractor:** Parses the HTML of the web pages visited by the crawler and extracts the relevant information using BeautifulSoup.
- **Backend Server:** Handles requests from the user, initiates the web crawler and data extractor, and returns the results. Built using Flask.
- **Frontend Interface:** (Optional) Allows users to input their search criteria and view the results in a user-friendly manner. Built using React.
- **Scheduler:** Automates the web searching process at regular intervals.

## Current USAGE (DEV)

1. **Set Up Your Environment:** Make sure you have Python installed on your system. If not, you can download it from the official Python website. You'll also need pip, which is the package installer for Python and comes pre-installed with Python 2.7.9+ and Python 3.4+.

2. **Install the Necessary Libraries:** You'll need the Selenium library for Python. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install selenium
```

3. **Download WebDriver:** Selenium requires a WebDriver to interface with your chosen browser. WebDrivers are browser-specific, so you'll need to download the one that matches the browser you want to use. For example, if you're using Chrome, you'll need to download ChromeDriver. Once downloaded, you'll need to add it to your system's PATH.

4. **Create Your Project Directory:** Create a new directory on your system where you'll store your project files.

5. **Create Your Python Script:** Inside your project directory, create a new Python script file (e.g., `web_search_bot.py`). This is where you'll write your code.

6. **Write Your Code:** Start by copying the sample code provided into your Python script. This will give you a basic structure to work from.

7. **Customize Your Code:** The sample code is very basic and needs to be filled in with your own logic. Here are some things you might want to consider:

   - **Search Criteria:** How will you input your search criteria? Will you hard-code it into your script, or will you allow user input?

   - **Web Navigation:** How will your bot navigate the web? Will it follow all links, or only certain ones? How will it avoid getting stuck in loops?

   - **Data Extraction:** What data will you extract from the web pages you visit? How will you identify the relevant information in the HTML?

   - **Error Handling:** How will your bot handle errors, such as a page not loading or a search yielding no results?

   - **Rate Limiting:** How will your bot avoid being rate-limited or blocked by websites? Some strategies might include varying the timing and order of your requests, rotating IP addresses, or using a pool of different user agents.

8. **Test Your Code:** As you write your code, be sure to test it frequently to catch any errors or bugs. This will save you time and effort in the long run.

9. **Iterate:** Based on your tests, you'll likely need to go back and revise your code multiple times before it's ready. This is a normal part of the process.

10. **Document Your Code:** Once your code is working as expected, make sure to document it. This includes writing helpful comments in the code itself, as well as updating your README with usage instructions and other relevant information.

Remember, building a web searching bot is a complex task that requires a good understanding of both the Python programming language and web technologies. Don't be discouraged if you run into challenges along the way. Keep experimenting, learning, and iterating on your code, and don't hesitate to ask for help if you need it.

Now, do you have any specific questions or concerns about these steps? Is there a particular aspect of the project that you're unsure about?
