# Ideas to update this function and project - then from that make new project about vision seeing computer and using mouse.:
# - Add more websitese to the list to use for like bing.com, duckduckgo.com, etc.
# - Add more error handling
# - Add more ways to process the search results (e.g. extract the title, link, and description)
# - Add more ways to process the page content (e.g. extract the text from the page)
# - Add more ways to search. Use GPT-4-vision-preview to search for image. By having a screen shot of tope 10 images and using GPT-4-vision-preview to help navigate and build a report.
# Use GPT-4-vision-preview to help navigate and build a report. for all the functions. I also want to eleminate the need for pre made actions  and use GPT-4-vision-preview to handle the web navigation.
# This needs to allow GPT-4-vision-preview to handle the web navigation by using the screen shot of where its at and assessing the page (having it select links and click on them).
# a nice mix of both where vision and text input are used with selenium to navigate the web.
# I possibly want to add in Tree of thouht (very hard to do).

I skipped to 4.


Great! To start with step 4, "Populate `.env`", you'll be setting up an environment file to store sensitive information like API keys securely. This step is crucial for maintaining the security of your API keys and other confidential configurations.

### Creating and Populating the `.env` File

1. **Create a `.env` File**: In the root directory of your project (`HumanWeb2/`), create a file named `.env`.

2. **Add Sensitive Information**:
   - OpenAI API Key: Used for interacting with GPT-4 and Assistants API.
   - Any other sensitive data like database credentials (if applicable).

   Your `.env` file might look something like this:

   ```plaintext
   OPENAI_API_KEY='your_openai_api_key_here'
   # Add other sensitive configurations as needed
   ```

3. **Use `python-dotenv` to Load `.env` File**: 
   - Install the `python-dotenv` package using pip: `pip install python-dotenv`.
   - In your Python scripts, use `python-dotenv` to load the variables from `.env`.

   Example usage in your Python script (e.g., in `main.py`):

   ```python
   from dotenv import load_dotenv
   import os

   load_dotenv()  # This loads the environment variables from .env

   # Accessing the API key
   openai_api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
   ```

4. **Add `.env` to `.gitignore`**: To prevent sensitive information from being pushed to your version control system, add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file. This ensures that `.env` is not tracked by Git.

   In your `.gitignore` file, add:

   ```plaintext
   .env
   ```

5. **Distribute `.env` File Securely**: If you're working in a team, share the `.env` file through secure channels. Never commit or push it to public repositories.

By following these steps, you ensure that your API keys and other sensitive configurations are securely managed and not exposed in your source code. You can now proceed to develop individual components of your project, using the environment variables as needed.


Step 5 involves developing individual components of your project based on the skeletons provided earlier. This step is crucial to ensure each part of your application works correctly before integrating them into the main application. Let's focus on developing each module in the `src/` directory.

### Developing Individual Components

#### 1. `src/automation/browser_automation.py`
In this module, you'll implement the logic for web automation using Selenium.

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys

def setup_driver(browser_name='chrome'):
    if browser_name == 'chrome':
        return webdriver.Chrome(executable_path='../drivers/chromedriver')
    # Additional browser setups can be added here
    return None

def perform_search(driver, query):
    driver.get("http://www.google.com")
    search_box = driver.find_element_by_name('q')
    search_box.send_keys(query)
    search_box.send_keys(Keys.RETURN)
    # Add more logic to handle search results
```

#### 2. `src/gpt/gpt_integration.py`
Here, you'll set up the integration with OpenAI's GPT-4-VisionPreview.

```python
import openai

def setup_openai(api_key):
    openai.api_key = api_key

def gpt_query(prompt):
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4-vision-preview",
        messages=[{"role": "system", "content": prompt}]
    )
    return response.choices[0].text
```

#### 3. `src/assistants/assistant_api.py`
Implement the functionality to interact with OpenAI's Assistants API.

```python
from openai import OpenAI

def create_assistant_thread(client, assistant_id):
    # Logic to create a thread and interact with an assistant
    pass
```

#### 4. `src/utils/screenshot.py`
Write code to capture and save screenshots.

```python
from PIL import ImageGrab

def capture_screenshot(filename='screenshot.png'):
    screenshot = ImageGrab.grab()
    screenshot.save(f'../screenshots/{filename}')
```

#### 5. `src/utils/pyautogui_control.py`
Implement mouse and keyboard control functions.

```python
import pyautogui

def move_and_click(x, y):
    pyautogui.moveTo(x, y)
    pyautogui.click()

def type_text(text):
    pyautogui.write(text, interval=0.1)
```

### Testing Each Component
After developing each component, you should test them individually to ensure they function as expected. This can be done by creating simple test scripts or using Python's interactive shell.

For example, to test `browser_automation.py`, you might write a small script within that file:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    driver = setup_driver()
    perform_search(driver, "OpenAI GPT-4")
    # Add additional test logic as needed
    driver.quit()
```

Similarly, test other components by writing small scripts or using the Python interactive shell to execute functions and validate their outputs.

### Integration
Once you're confident that each component works correctly on its own, you can start integrating them in `src/main.py`. This involves calling functions from different modules to execute a series of actions in a coordinated manner, such as capturing a webpage, analyzing it with GPT-4-VisionPreview, and interacting with it based on the analysis.

After completing this step, you'll have a set of independently functioning modules ready to be integrated into your main application logic.


The next step is to integrate mouse control with vision capabilities into your project. This involves capturing screenshots of the browser, analyzing them with GPT-4-VisionPreview to identify actionable elements (like buttons or links), and then using PyAutoGUI to simulate mouse movements and clicks based on the analysis. Here's how you can proceed:

### 1. Capture and Analyze Screenshots
- Modify `src/utils/screenshot.py` to capture screenshots of the browser window.
- Use GPT-4-VisionPreview in `src/gpt/gpt_integration.py` to analyze these screenshots and determine where to click or what actions to perform.

### 2. Implement Vision-Based Mouse Control
- In `src/utils/pyautogui_control.py`, add functions to move the mouse and perform clicks based on coordinates provided by the GPT-4 analysis.
- Ensure you handle coordinates transformation correctly if your screen resolution differs from the browser's viewport resolution.

### 3. Integrate Vision and Mouse Control in Main Application
- In `src/main.py`, orchestrate the workflow where you capture a screenshot, send it to GPT-4-VisionPreview for analysis, and then use PyAutoGUI to interact with the browser based on this analysis.

### 4. Example Workflow in `src/main.py`
Here's a simplified example of how these components might work together in `main.py`:

```python
from automation.browser_automation import setup_driver
from utils.screenshot import capture_screenshot
from gpt.gpt_integration import gpt_query
from utils.pyautogui_control import move_and_click
import os

def main():
    # Setup the driver and GPT-4
    driver = setup_driver()
    driver.get("http://example.com")  # Navigate to the desired webpage
    
    # Capture a screenshot
    capture_screenshot('current_view.png')

    # Analyze the screenshot with GPT-4-VisionPreview
    analysis_result = gpt_query("Analyze the screenshot and suggest an action")
    print("GPT-4 Analysis Result:", analysis_result)

    # Based on the analysis, perform actions using PyAutoGUI
    # This is an example, you'll need to parse the GPT-4 result to get actual coordinates and actions
    move_and_click(100, 200)  # Coordinates to be determined by GPT-4 analysis

    # Close the browser
    driver.quit()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### 5. Parsing GPT-4-VisionPreview Output
- The critical part of this integration is correctly interpreting the output from GPT-4-VisionPreview. You need to parse this output to extract meaningful actions and coordinates.
- Depending on the output format, you might need to write a parser that can understand the instructions and translate them into screen coordinates and actions.

### 6. Testing and Iteration
- Test this integrated workflow thoroughly. It's likely to require several iterations to handle different types of web pages and elements correctly.
- Pay special attention to how accurately GPT-4-VisionPreview interprets the screenshots and how well your application translates these interpretations into mouse actions.

By following these steps, you'll be able to build a system that uses AI-powered vision to control a web browser in a sophisticated and interactive manner.

To achieve the functionality where the website's HTML code is fed into GPT-4-VisionPreview along with the screenshot for better context, and to enable GPT-4 to prompt function calls for browsing and navigating, you can follow these steps:

### 1. Extract HTML Code of the Current Webpage

In your Selenium automation script (`browser_automation.py`), you can add a function to get the current page's HTML source code.

#### `src/automation/browser_automation.py`
```python
def get_page_source(driver):
    return driver.page_source
```

### 2. Modify GPT-4 Integration to Accept HTML and Screenshot

You'll need to adjust the GPT-4 integration to accept both the screenshot and the HTML code of the webpage. This requires converting the screenshot to a format that can be sent to GPT-4 (like base64 encoding) and combining it with the HTML code in a prompt.

#### `src/gpt/gpt_integration.py`
```python
import base64

def gpt_query_with_context(prompt, image_path=None, html=None):
    image_content = None
    if image_path:
        with open(image_path, "rb") as image_file:
            image_content = base64.b64encode(image_file.read()).decode('utf-8')

    combined_prompt = {
        "role": "system",
        "content": {
            "text": prompt,
            "image": image_content,
            "html": html
        }
    }

    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4-vision-preview",
        messages=[combined_prompt]
    )
    return response.choices[0].text
```

### 3. Implement Function Calling in Main Application

In your main script (`main.py`), you should orchestrate the entire process: taking a screenshot, extracting HTML, sending them to GPT-4, and executing actions based on GPT-4's response.

#### `src/main.py`
```python
from automation.browser_automation import setup_driver, get_page_source
from utils.screenshot import capture_screenshot
from gpt.gpt_integration import gpt_query_with_context
from utils.pyautogui_control import move_and_click, type_text
# Import additional functions as needed

def main():
    driver = setup_driver()
    driver.get("http://example.com")

    # Get the HTML source of the webpage
    html_source = get_page_source(driver)

    # Capture a screenshot
    screenshot_path = 'current_view.png'
    capture_screenshot(screenshot_path)

    # Query GPT-4 with HTML and screenshot
    gpt_response = gpt_query_with_context("Analyze and suggest actions", image_path=screenshot_path, html=html_source)
    print("GPT-4 Response:", gpt_response)

    # Parse the GPT-4 response to determine actions (this will require custom parsing logic)
    # Example: if gpt_response indicates clicking a button, find the button coordinates and use PyAutoGUI to click

    driver.quit()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### 4. Parsing GPT-4 Response

- The response from GPT-4 will likely contain instructions or actions to be performed on the webpage. You need to parse these instructions to extract meaningful actions (like clicking a button, entering text, etc.).
- Implement a parser that can understand the instructions from GPT-4 and translate them into actions using PyAutoGUI or Selenium.

### 5. Test the Integration

- Test the complete workflow to ensure the integration works as expected.
- Pay attention to how well GPT-4 interprets the combined input of the screenshot and HTML source.
- Fine-tune the parsing logic to handle a variety of instructions from GPT-4.

By following these steps, you'll create a system where GPT-4-VisionPreview has a comprehensive understanding of the webpage (both visually and structurally) and can make more informed decisions about navigation and interaction.
