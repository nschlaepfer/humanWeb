The project you provided as a reference is a web scraper that tracks prices on e-commerce websites. It's a Python-based project that uses Flask for the backend and React for the frontend. It also includes a scheduler for automation. The project structure is divided into three main subdirectories: Backend, frontend, and scheduler.

# Tech Spec Plan

## Project Name: Web Searching Bot

### Overview

The Web Searching Bot is a program designed to browse the internet as if it were a user. It will be capable of navigating through web pages, following links, and extracting relevant information based on user-defined criteria. The bot will be designed to overcome common web crawling issues such as rate limits.

### Technical Stack

1. **Programming Language:** Python
2. **Web Scraping Library:** BeautifulSoup
3. **Web Automation Library:** Selenium
4. **Backend Framework:** Flask
5. **Frontend Framework:** React (optional, if you want a user interface)

### Components

1. **Web Crawler:** The web crawler will be responsible for navigating the web. It will use Selenium to simulate a real user's behavior, such as clicking on links and scrolling through pages.

2. **Data Extractor:** The data extractor will parse the HTML of the web pages visited by the crawler and extract the relevant information. It will use BeautifulSoup for this purpose.

3. **Backend Server:** The backend server will handle requests from the user, initiate the web crawler and data extractor, and return the results. It will be built using Flask.

4. **Frontend Interface:** (Optional) If you want a user interface, a frontend can be built using React. This will allow users to input their search criteria and view the results in a user-friendly manner.

5. **Scheduler:** A scheduler can be used to automate the web searching process at regular intervals.

### Workflow

1. The user inputs their search criteria via the frontend interface or directly to the backend server.
2. The backend server initiates the web crawler with the given criteria.
3. The web crawler navigates the web, visiting pages that match the criteria.
4. The data extractor parses the visited pages and extracts the relevant information.
5. The extracted information is returned to the user.

This is a high-level plan and can be further detailed based on your specific requirements. Once we agree on the tech spec, we can proceed to create a README and then the necessary code to start the project.
