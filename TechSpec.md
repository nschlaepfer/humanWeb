## Tech Spec Plan

### Overview

The Web Searching Bot is a program designed to browse the internet as if it were a user. It will be capable of navigating through web pages, following links, and extracting relevant information based on user-defined criteria. The bot will be designed to overcome common web crawling issues such as rate limits.

### Technical Stack

1. **Programming Language:** Python
2. **Web Automation Library:** Selenium
3. **Web Scraping Library:** BeautifulSoup (optional, for more complex data extraction)

### Components

1. **Web Crawler:** The web crawler will be responsible for navigating the web. It will use Selenium to simulate a real user's behavior, such as clicking on links and scrolling through pages.

2. **Data Extractor:** The data extractor will parse the HTML of the web pages visited by the crawler and extract the relevant information. It can use Selenium's built-in methods for simple data extraction, or BeautifulSoup for more complex tasks.

### Workflow

1. The user inputs their search criteria.
2. The web crawler navigates the web, visiting pages that match the criteria.
3. The data extractor parses the visited pages and extracts the relevant information.
4. The extracted information is returned to the user.
